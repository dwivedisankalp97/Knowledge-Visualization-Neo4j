The Huffington Post was one of the first crowd-sourced news platforms allowing many people and bloggers who were not full-time employees to use HuffPo as a medium for their views (a model that Jonah Peretti one of The Huffington Post’s founders would also use in his later venture Buzzfeed). The Huffington Post was also  an important player in the wave of media companies monetizing through digital ads rather than subscription or paywalls which has fundamentally changed that industry. When it was acquired HuffPo had revenue of approximately $30M while this year it projected revenue is $168M.

 Microsoft,buy, Mojang,Microsoft bought Mojang the maker of wildly popular game Minecraft for $2.5B at the end of 2014. Minecraft was entirely bootstrapped proving you don’t need to raise money to be a unicorn and exit at $1B+. The acquisition highlighted Microsoft’s new strategy of focusing on mobile-centric products and bolsters Microsoft’s gaming product line. Microsoft already has an enviable perch in the gaming industry given the Xbox desktop and VR platforms it currently owns. The acquisition also gives Microsoft a channel into the younger demographics that Minecraft targets specifically people below the age of 15 and could easily become a multibillion dollar franchise on its own similar to the multimedia empire that Lego built. Finally watching how Microsoft handles Minecraft going forward will be important since it not only has to handle the game itself but needs to make sure that the community that’s developed around the game is maintained (a struggle many large companies face when acquiring community-centric startups).

 Amazon,acquire, Zappos,Amazon acquired Zappos for $807M+ in 2009 in one of the largest e-commerce acquisitions to happen after the dot-com era. The deal been fruitful for Amazon which acquired a company that already had net revenue of $635M at the time of acquisition. Zappos has also carved a niche out for itself in e-commerce by emphasizing its company culture and obsessive customer service the latter of which Amazon prides itself on today and has been a big differentiator for the parent company. It’s important to note that Amazon bought Zappos at a little more than 1x net revenue which is a much lower multiple than the valuation of many e-commerce companies today (with Amazon itself trading between 2x and 2.5x price-to-sales ratio of the trailing twelve months).

 eBay,acquisition, PayPal,Back in November 2006 I published the Top 10 Greatest Internet Digital Media M&A Deals of All Time.  It included eBay’s $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal Yahoo’s $1.6 billion acquisition of Overture and Microsoft’s $400 million purchase of Hotmail back in 1998.  It also included News Corp’s $580 million acquisition of MySpace.  Don’t laugh.   The list was published a month after the big $900 million deal with Google which I thought Google had drastically overpaid for at the time.  Of course times they change as does the list so I decided to update the list – and yes I went through all 255 pages on the Acquisitions section of CrunchBase.

 Amazon,scoop, Zappos,Were it not for the RIP Good Times presentation that Sequoia gave its portfolio company CEOs in late 2008 it’s entirely possible that Zappos would still be independent.  But the fact remains Jeff Bezos met his match in Zappos’ CEO Tony Hsieh on the customer satisfaction front.  By scooping up Zappos Amazon basically acquired the lone threat in the e-commerce landscape.

 eBay,acquire, Paypal,eBay dropped its Billpoint product and agreed to acquire Paypal for $1.5 billion.  Considering that about 60% of PayPal’s business came from eBay you have to wonder why eBay didn’t apply some pressure to bring down the price but the fact remains: PayPal drove eBay’s revenues and is now clearly the most exciting part of the business.  The deal also gave rise to a whole generation of Internet entrepreneurs and investors who went onto found or invest in companies such as Facebook LinkedIn and Yelp.

 Google,buy, YouTube,Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock and within the first few days saw its market valuation rise by well over $2 billion.  By doing so it inadvertently blocked its only true threat as a search engine by scooping up what was to become the No. 2 search engine in the world.  It can be argued that  every 1% search market share is worth $1 billion.

 Google,buy, YouTube,But this misses the point were it not Android it could be argued that Google would have found something else (internal or via acquisition) to do what Android does.  Google made Android into what it is today.  However YouTube was a force to be reckoned with and at the time of the acquisition the most explosive startup ever.  Sequoia had only poured $11.5 million of venture funding into the company.  YouTube had the runway—forget what Mark Cuban says he did after all sell Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion to Yahoo—to become a threat the way Facebook has become a threat.  By buying YouTube Google scorched the earth in online video.
