signed into law by president chester a. arthur , the act , which drastically curtailed the number of chinese people allowed to enter the country , was among the earliest united states laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration .
as united states citizens , they were entitled to bring over their relatives — or , in the case of gen yeo and his father , “ paper sons ” posing as relatives .

despite spending billions of dollars on drugs and dieting programs , even the most motivated are working against their own biology .
but what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies , which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights , whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off .
he cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight .

if you want to start running each morning , it ’ s essential that you choose a simple cue ( like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day ) and a clear reward ( like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles , or the endorphin rush you get from a jog ) .
but countless studies have shown that , at first , the rewards inherent in exercise aren ’ t enough .
so to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward , you need to give yourself something you really enjoy — like a small piece of chocolate — after your workout .
but the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue ( “ it ’ s 5 o ’ clock ” ) with a routine ( “ three miles down !
” ) and a reward ( “ chocolate !

the office of congressional ethics refused to shut down its inquiry , and it published its findings on its own after the ethics committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing ( although the committee urged them to return the gifts ) .

on a day usually reserved for pomp , constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses , congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles .
as democrats in both chambers seethed , senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the affordable care act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring , even if any replacement of the law could take years .
under arcane budget procedures , that legislation would be protected from a democratic filibuster and could pass the senate with a simple majority .
that provoked an outcry from both democrats and voters who flooded house offices with angry calls .

” on tuesday , the house also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law .
the document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved .
nor does it specify or even suggest how republicans would replace the affordable care act , which the obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured .
republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill , to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law .

” mr. lieberman , as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment , had attended the military court to support sergeant azaria and called the legal proceedings a “ theater of the absurd .

video footage showed sergeant azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause , and he was embraced by his family and friends .
hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound , shouting slogans like “ free the boy .
local television stations frequently showed images of sergeant azaria ’ s distraught parents hugging him in court .
appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism , and where most jewish are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service , his supporters portrayed him as “ everybody ’ s child .

he then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences .
but even a modest raise for ms. kelly would place her among television ’ s journalists .
in a brief interview , mr .
that show will be in the vein of cbs ’ s “ 60 minutes , ” where mr .
lack worked early in his career .
” yet the move has its risks for all involved , especially the daytime program .
in an interview with charlie rose on “ cbs sunday morning ” last year , ms. kelly described the television show of her fantasies .
wouldn ’ t you watch that ? ” ms. kelly kept a relatively low profile on tuesday , addressing her own news at the end of that night ’ s edition of “ the kelly file .
her last show on fox is on friday . ''
ms. kelly , 46 , will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years .
ms. kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch .
a daily daytime talk show also poses risks .
” the audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than fox ’ s viewership .
starting a sunday rival to “ 60 minutes , ” the among newsmagazines , is likewise no easy task .
nbc ’ s most recent newsmagazine , “ on assignment , ” ran against “ 60 minutes ” over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers , compared with more than nine million for “ 60 minutes , ” which broadcast two repeats during that time .
( this season , “ 60 minutes ” is averaging more than 14 million viewers . )
it is also unclear how nbc will accommodate ms. kelly ’ s show during the national football league season , when nbc ’ s popular “ sunday night football ” package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. eastern .
lack presided over nbc in the 1990s when newsmagazines , including the network ’ s popular “ dateline , ” dominated lineups .
when greta van susteren , another veteran anchor , announced her departure in september , network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in .
in the end , ms. kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to fox news viewers — her last show is friday .

in september , he revisited his old school in beijing , where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game , according to memoirs of his former teacher .
“ i laid the basis for that through sports when i was young .
in the main pro trading season last year , the 16 chinese super league teams spent about $ 300 million hiring away promising foreign players , outstripping player spending by the english premier league by nearly $ 120 million , according to fifa tms , a player transfer data company .
“ that was unthinkable before .
but even here , the children come to the game later than their european and south american counterparts , and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics , said sergio zarco diaz , a spanish coach .
some schools , facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields , have devised their own drills , like soccer gymnastics , in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up , down and around .
it may impress visiting officials , but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game , said zhang lu , a widely respected soccer commentator .
on a recent afternoon , the smog that often covers beijing lifted and the children of caoqiao elementary school rushed onto the fields , shouting and squealing with delight .
“ but at midday i notified the kids that it was back on , and they all went crazy with relief .
” ''
that worries lawmakers .
the dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom .
nearly a year ago , i argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business , one that is typified less by the storied in a garage than by a posse i like to call the frightful five : amazon , apple , facebook , microsoft and alphabet , google ’ s parent company .
in the united states , europe , asia and south america , the five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers , and often even against popular will .
the precise nature of the fights varies by company and region , including the tax and antitrust investigations of apple and google in europe and donald j. trump ’ s broad and often incoherent criticism of the five for various alleged misdeeds .
let ’ s start with some stats .
apple ’ s sales were flat last year , and after a monster 2016 , alphabet ’ s stock price hit a plateau .
the exceptions were microsoft , which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s , and amazon , which got under people ’ s skin for , among other things , making books cheaper and more widely accessible , thereby hurting bookstores .
but generally people loved tech giants .
they weren ’ t selling cigarettes .
when apple took on the federal bureau of investigation last year over access to a terrorist ’ s iphone , many in tech sided with the company , but a majority of americans thought apple should give in .
he promised to force apple to make iphones in america .
that ’ s where we are now .
details were sparse , and there were no clues to the gunman ’ s motives .
both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with mr. chen previously , but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing .
killings dropped to 79 in 2016 , from 129 in 2015 .
murders also fell , to 335 from 352 the year before .
the new york city police commissioner , james p. o ’ neill , has noted the department ’ s efforts to push shootings below 1 , 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s , when the police began keeping similar records .
” violent crime has been more persistent in some communities , especially outside manhattan .
murders on playgrounds climbed to 12 , from three the year before , and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles .
more broadly , murders indoors ticked up by 19 , while outdoor murders fell by 49 .
but he is no longer , by his own calculations , a member of the “ elite .
” as an adjective , the word “ elite ” still conveys something positive , even aspirational : elite athlete , elite model , elite travel services .
in this formulation , elites are a destructive , condescending collective , plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks .
the club for growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad , instructing the democrat howard dean to “ take his new york freak show back to vermont where it belongs .
“ i was on the right side of that issue , as you know , with the people , ” he boasted after brexit , adding that “ hillary , as always , stood with the elites .
but trump has also ventured beyond mere turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems : the “ people ” versus the “ elites .
the jacksonians rebelled against the founders ’ aristocratic pretensions .
” hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an “ elite .
as individuals , they might be republicans or democrats , and might live in ohio or california .
it was during bill clinton ’ s presidency that the social critic christopher lasch published “ the revolt of the elites and the betrayal of democracy , ” which mourned that “ liberals ” had turned into “ petulant , intolerant ” scolds , thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of middle america .
otherwise , the man in the white house will do it for them . ''

by a vote of 51 to 48 on wednesday , the senate took the first step , agreeing to take up a budget resolution , or blueprint , that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the law .
as republicans charged ahead , both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law , which has become deeply enmeshed with america ’ s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people .
he advised that republicans needed to “ be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster , ” and added , “ don ’ t let the schumer clowns out of this web .
” but as republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law , they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time .

here is a primer .

in the senate , a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority .
for other bills , a majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote .
q .
why is it called reconciliation ?
a .
q .
a .
since 1980 , congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills .
twenty became law .
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “ reagan revolution .
” it squeezed savings out of social security , medicare , medicaid , food stamps , the school lunch program , farm subsidies , student loans , welfare and jobless benefits , among many other programs .
congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill , the balanced budget act of 1997 .
that law also created the children ’ s health insurance program , primarily for uninsured children in families .
on the same day in 1997 , mr. clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes .
the bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by president george w. bush in 2001 and 2003 .
later , when republicans controlled both houses of congress , they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the affordable care act , but mr. obama vetoed the bill in january 2016 .
” q .
a .
senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours , so it can not be filibustered on the senate floor .
the senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the byrd rule , but the senate can waive the rule with a majority .
q .
what does this mean for the affordable care act ?
those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill mr. obama vetoed last january .

“ when you cut off the water , we dig for water .
” like most of syria ’ s problems , the damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war , which has killed hundreds of thousands of people , displaced about half the country ’ s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government , armed rebels and jihadist groups .
the crisis began on dec. 22 , when the water stopped flowing .

“ it has become our ultimate hope in damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine .

we set out in her car , exploring the of vancouver island , heading for the northern tip , port hardy .
this would turn out to be the last trip we took together .

kingsmill ’ s daughter , diana , who had a lifelong association with pacifist quakers , took over grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center , staging legendary games that recreated the infamous stanford prison experiment as a way to train the “ prisoners ” to fight oppression with noncooperation — a practice that ended after a disastrous fake “ invasion ” by a local biker gang retained for the purpose .
grindstone was full of kids like me : babies who attended alternative public schools in toronto , kingston and ottawa , who could rhyme the classic protest chant “ ” with the facility of lifelong practice .
today it sounds hopelessly idealistic .
but in the ’ 80s , grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists .

the jobs that have been disappearing , like machine operator , are predominantly those that men do .
why ?
of the jobs , many are various types of health aides , which are about 90 percent female .
when men take these jobs , they have more job security and wage growth than in work , according to recent research .
i ’ m very worried about whether there will be jobs for adults , especially the males , who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs .
” take tracy dawson , 53 , a welder in st. clair , mo .
he lost several jobs , some because his employers took the work to china and mexico and others because the workers were replaced by robots .
he has heard the promises of jobs in the health care field : his daughter trained to be a medical technician .
“ i don ’ t want it to sound bad , but i ’ ve always seen a woman in the position of a nurse or some kind of health care worker .
i see it as more of a woman ’ s touch .
” also , health aides earn a median wage of $ 10 .
50 an hour .
women were hit harder than men by the decline in jobs , according to mr. autor .
yet when men , especially white men , enter fields , they are paid more and promoted faster than women , a phenomenon known as the glass escalator .
“ it ’ s not that they couldn ’ t become a health worker , it ’ s that people have backward views of what their identity is .
but they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time , while wages were stagnant .
technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician — requiring more training but not a college degree — paid 22 percent more than other jobs , after controlling for things like education .
they involve less interaction with patients and more with computers , so they are less stereotypically feminine .
there is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs , the study found .
black men were 3 .
3 times as likely as white men to take the health jobs , and other minority men were 1 .
8 times as likely .
white men were more likely to take the technical jobs .

73,17368 , apple removes new york times apps from its store in china - the new york times , new york times , katie benner and sui-lee wee,2017-01-05,2017.0,1.0 , , '' apple , complying with what it said was a request from chinese authorities , removed news apps created by the new york times from its app store in china late last month .
apple removed both the and apps from the app store in china on dec. 23 .
“ for some time now the new york times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in china and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations , ” fred sainz , an apple spokesman , said of the times apps .
“ as a result , the app must be taken down off the china app store .
” mr. sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the times apps were said to have violated , who had contacted apple and when , and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented .
chinese law prohibits the publication of “ harmful information ” online , and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable .
apple has previously removed other , less prominent media apps from its china store .
apple ’ s chief executive , timothy d. cook , has said that the company complies with all local laws .
while in early 2016 apple resisted a court request in the united states for it to help federal officials unlock an iphone for a criminal investigation , mr. cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down .
in the end , the government was able to unlock the device without apple ’ ’ s help and the case was dropped .
farzana aslam , associate director of the center for comparative and public law at the university of hong kong , noted that in matters involving customer privacy , apple requires governments to submit subpoenas , search warrants or other legal documents .
on dec. 23 , david barboza , a times reporter , spoke with members of apple ’ s media team about the article .
mr. barboza had previously been in touch with the iphone factory owner , foxconn .
he had also contacted the chinese government as part of his reporting .
later that day , a separate team from apple informed the times that the apps would be removed , ms. murphy said .
the times news apps remain available in apple ’ s app stores for other countries , as well as the hong kong and taiwan stores , but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland china to download them .
apple ’ s decision to remove the app from its china store should not affect those who have already installed it .
in april , apple ’ s ibooks store and itunes movies were shut down in the country , just six months after they were introduced there .

but a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship — hailed at the time as the largest ever built , and praised for its professed unsinkability — may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to new york from southampton , england .
” mr. molony ’ s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in wiltshire , in southwest england , where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship ’ s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century .
about four years ago , a collaborator of mr. molony ’ s acquired the rare photographs of the ship , meticulously taken by harland and wolff ’ s engineering chief before it left a belfast shipyard .
mr. molony called the photographs “ the titanic equivalent of tutankhamen ’ s tomb , ” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed , including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage .
mr. molony contends that the ship ’ s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go , since delaying the ship ’ s journey would have been financially ruinous .
at the time of departure , the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea , away from the dock , and therefore concealed from passengers .
the titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories , among them that it was not the titanic that sank on april 15 , 1912 , but , rather the olympic , its sister ship that the titanic was torpedoed by a german or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an egyptian priestess ’ s mummy .
popularized by hollywood , the story of the titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture .
now the political editor at the irish daily mail , mr. molony , who has also written a book called “ the irish aboard titanic , ” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship , where cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of passengers , many of them irish , stayed below .
not everyone is convinced .
david hill , a former honorary secretary of the british titanic society , who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s , argued that , while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster , the blaze was not the decisive factor .
“ a fire may have accelerated this .
it was not the catastrophe at sea .

yared tamene , the contractor at the d. n. c. who fielded the call , was no expert in cyberattacks .
by his own account , he did not look too hard even after special agent hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks — in part because he wasn ’ t certain the caller was a real f. b. i. agent and not an impostor .
while there ’ s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack , this much is clear : a weapon that russia had in elections from ukraine to europe was trained on the united states , with devastating effectiveness .
“ there shouldn ’ t be any doubt in anybody ’ s mind , ” adm. michael s. rogers , the director of the national security agency and commander of united states cyber command , said at a postelection conference .
” the united states , too , has carried out cyberattacks , and in decades past the c. i .
a. tried to subvert foreign elections .
mr. tamene , who reports to mr. brown and fielded the call from the f. b. i. agent , was not a d. n. c. employee he works for a contracting firm called the mis department .
he was left to figure out , largely on his own , how to respond — and even whether the man who had called in to the d. n. c. switchboard was really an f. b. i. agent .
he added that “ the special agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed ‘ dukes ’ by the u. s. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles .
so when special agent hawkins called repeatedly in october , leaving voice mail messages for mr. tamene , urging him to call back , “ i did not return his calls , as i had nothing to report , ” mr. tamene explained in his memo .

they stole the designs for the fighter jet , corporate secrets for rolling steel , even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the united states .
but they didn ’ t publish any of it .
the russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes .
there was always a reason : fear of escalating a cyberwar , and concern that the united states needed russia ’ s cooperation in negotiations over syria .
but it didn ’ t happen .
last year , the attacks became more aggressive .
around christmas , it attacked part of the power grid in ukraine , dropping a portion of the country into darkness , killing backup generators and taking control of generators .
in retrospect , it was a warning shot .
“ the d. n. c. may have been hacked in a serious way this week , with password theft , etc .

fancy bear , sometimes called a. p. t. 28 and believed to be directed by the g. r. u. russia ’ s military intelligence agency , is an older outfit , tracked by western investigators for nearly a decade .
attribution , as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known , is more art than science .
it is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty .
another clue : the russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the moscow time zone .
and we did not yet know what they had taken .
there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty .
and it was chilling .

” computer experts drew the same conclusion about dcleaks .
for republican operatives , it was insider gold .

“ hope not , ” mr. biden responded .

” a covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect , he added .
they will wrestle with , among other things , mr. putin ’ s motive .
or was it , as the c. i .
a. concluded last month , a deliberate attempt to elect mr. trump ?
in fact , the russian scheme accomplished all three goals .
” ''
in a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country ’ s autocratic ruler , the united nations official , juan e. méndez , was again denied , this time with a jeering dismissal .
“ when the u. s. was engaging in torture , that created an enormous of the pendulum , ” he added .
“ it ’ s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles — the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture , including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account , ” she added .
in argentina , omar graffigna , the former chief of the country ’ s air force , was sentenced to prison in september for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two activists , patricia roisinblit and josé manuel pérez rojo .
at the same time , mr. trump ’ s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries , like russia and the philippines , to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture .
“ it couldn ’ t be worse .
” ''
how they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation ’ s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear .
nor is it yet evident that millions of americans with medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage .
whether they can meet that goal is unclear .
but that language has real teeth .
house republicans have some practice at this , because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law .
the committees — house energy and commerce , house ways and means , senate finance , and senate health , education , labor and pensions — will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law .
such bills can be adopted under special procedures .
so the legislation , as now conceived , would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact , such as the prohibition on insurers ’ denying coverage to people with conditions .
but a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode , leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before republicans have prepared a replacement .
” republican leadership officials in the house acknowledge the possibility of “ cascading effects ” if the payments , which have totaled an estimated $ 13 billion , are suddenly stopped .
nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there .
in lobbies and family apartments , outside methadone clinics and art studios , people take note of the inequity .
they watch witnesses cower behind doors , more fearful of a gunman ’ s crew than confident in the police department ’ s ability to protect them .
so though people see a lot , they rarely testify .
and in the south bronx , as in so many predominantly black and hispanic neighborhoods like it in the united states , the contract between the police and the community is in tatters .
this is the paradox of policing in the 40th precinct .
but precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes .
that ’ s how i feel .
in the chasm between the police and the community , gangs and gun violence flourish .
both are unsolved .
he lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles , empty dope bags and discarded hennessy bottles .
he chose the police .
“ there ’ s a lot of killers here , and we are going to kill you , ” a sergeant ’ s police report quoted a telling mr. fernandez in august 2015 .
michael j. lopuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th precinct station house .
“ and people just don ’ t understand that .
” often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police .
of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the bronx through early september , more than a third — 66 victims — refused to cooperate .
part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics , like that were a hallmark of the style under former mayor michael r. bloomberg and his police commissioner , raymond w. kelly .

the workload in the 40th precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in manhattan compared with the bronx , brooklyn and queens .
by contrast , a detective in the precinct on the southern end of staten island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling union square and gramercy park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of washington heights handles 32 , the citywide median .
michael palladino , the head of the detectives ’ endowment association and a former bronx officer , said staffing disparities affected the department ’ s efforts to build trust in communities like the south bronx .
retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city ’ s last “ ” the busiest precincts .
“ the outer boroughs are , like , forgotten .
” the bronx ’ s struggles extend into prosecutions .
they buy chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect .
they carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer .
they buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son ’ s ashes in a box .
victims ’ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance .
newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts , pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at police headquarters .
in a stuffy squad room , the detectives of the 40th precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect .

but what they did not know was that the film ’ s striking appearance had been created by a chinese immigrant artist , who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the song dynasty .
in the years that followed , he endured poverty , discrimination and chronic lack of recognition , not only for his work at disney but also for his fine art , before finding acclaim in his 90s .
in 1932 and again in 1934 , his work was included in group shows at the art institute of chicago that also featured picasso , matisse and paul klee .
over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for disney and films for warner brothers and other studios , among them “ the sands of iwo jima ” ( 1949 ) “ rebel without a cause ” ( 1955 ) and “ the wild bunch ” ( 1969 ) .
” in 2013 and 2014 , mr. wong was the subject of “ water to paper , paint to sky , ” a major retrospective at the disney family museum in san francisco .
from the museum ’ s windows , which overlook san francisco bay , he could contemplate angel island , where more than nine decades earlier , as a lone he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him .
wong gen yeo ( the name is sometimes romanized wong gaing yoo ) was born on oct. 25 , 1910 , in a farming village in guangdong province .
they were obliged to travel under false identities — a state of affairs known among chinese immigrants as being a “ paper son ” — in the hope of circumventing the chinese exclusion act of 1882 .
signed into law by president chester a. arthur , the act , which drastically curtailed the number of chinese people allowed to enter the country , was among the earliest united states laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration .
as united states citizens , they were entitled to bring over their relatives — or , in the case of gen yeo and his father , “ paper sons ” posing as relatives .
attuned to the deception , united states immigration officials put chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be .
where in the house is the rice bin ?
are there trees in your village ?
what shops can you name ?
the sponsoring relative was interrogated separately , and the answers had to match .
to stand a chance of passing , aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers .
the ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults .
on dec. 30 , 1920 , after a month at sea , the wongs landed at angel island immigration station .
” because mr. wong ’ s father had previously lived in the united states as look get , he was able to clear immigration quickly .
but as a new arrival , gen yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month , the only child among the immigrants being held there .
i hated that place .
for reasons that have been lost to time , he could not take his son .
tyrus lived on his own in a sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school .
they lived in a boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel .
his first art teacher was his father , who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper : they could not afford ink or drawing paper .
by his own account an indifferent student in public school , tyrus found his calling at the institute , now the otis college of art and design .
his father scraped together the $ 90 tuition — a small fortune — to let him stay on as otis ’ s youngest student .
not long afterward his father died , leaving young mr. wong entirely on his own .
in trying to animate the book , disney had reached an impasse .
mr. wong spied his chance .
’ ” mr. wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist .
“ but he was more than that , ” mr. canemaker explained .
the indignities he endured were not confined to the studios .
trying to buy a house , he and his wife , the former ruth kim , were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold .
“ then in a month you ’ d go back there and the sign was still there , ” mr. wong recalled in “ tyrus .
“ and that ’ s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war .
” mr. wong , who became a united states citizen in 1946 , also designed christmas cards for hallmark and painted elegant designs on dinnerware , now sought after by collectors .
a longtime resident of sunland , calif. he became , in retirement , a renowned kitemaker , designing , building and hand coloring astonishing , airworthy creations — butterflies , swallows , whole flocks of owls , centipedes more than 100 feet long — that streaked the southern california sky like paint on blue canvas .
in 2001 , in formal recognition of his influence on “ bambi , ” mr. wong was named a disney legend .
the disney family museum ’ s retrospective , “ water to paper , paint to sky , ” traveled in 2015 to the museum of chinese in america , in lower manhattan .
mr. wong ’ s death , at his home in sunland , was confirmed by the filmmaker ms. tom .

but what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies , which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights , whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off .

but countless studies have shown that , at first , the rewards inherent in exercise aren ’ t enough .
so to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward , you need to give yourself something you really enjoy — like a small piece of chocolate — after your workout .

as democrats in both chambers seethed , senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the affordable care act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring , even if any replacement of the law could take years .

nor does it specify or even suggest how republicans would replace the affordable care act , which the obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured .

ms. kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch .
a daily daytime talk show also poses risks .
” the audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than fox ’ s viewership .
starting a sunday rival to “ 60 minutes , ” the among newsmagazines , is likewise no easy task .
nbc ’ s most recent newsmagazine , “ on assignment , ” ran against “ 60 minutes ” over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers , compared with more than nine million for “ 60 minutes , ” which broadcast two repeats during that time .
( this season , “ 60 minutes ” is averaging more than 14 million viewers . )
it is also unclear how nbc will accommodate ms. kelly ’ s show during the national football league season , when nbc ’ s popular “ sunday night football ” package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. eastern .
lack presided over nbc in the 1990s when newsmagazines , including the network ’ s popular “ dateline , ” dominated lineups .
when greta van susteren , another veteran anchor , announced her departure in september , network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in .
in the end , ms. kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to fox news viewers — her last show is friday .
it is not clear who will replace her .
it is a moonshot for china , whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition .
these giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer .
as well as paying tens of millions for foreign players , chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into european clubs , hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise .
“ spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons .
there has been resistance by parents , worried about their children taking precious time away from academics , as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent .
but when it gets down to the level in the provinces , it ’ s like people doing their own thing .
“ just not so blatantly .
in september , he revisited his old school in beijing , where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game , according to memoirs of his former teacher .
“ i laid the basis for that through sports when i was young .
in the main pro trading season last year , the 16 chinese super league teams spent about $ 300 million hiring away promising foreign players , outstripping player spending by the english premier league by nearly $ 120 million , according to fifa tms , a player transfer data company .
“ that was unthinkable before .
but even here , the children come to the game later than their european and south american counterparts , and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics , said sergio zarco diaz , a spanish coach .
some schools , facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields , have devised their own drills , like soccer gymnastics , in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up , down and around .
it may impress visiting officials , but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game , said zhang lu , a widely respected soccer commentator .
on a recent afternoon , the smog that often covers beijing lifted and the children of caoqiao elementary school rushed onto the fields , shouting and squealing with delight .
“ but at midday i notified the kids that it was back on , and they all went crazy with relief .
” ''
that worries lawmakers .
the dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom .
nearly a year ago , i argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business , one that is typified less by the storied in a garage than by a posse i like to call the frightful five : amazon , apple , facebook , microsoft and alphabet , google ’ s parent company .
in the united states , europe , asia and south america , the five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers , and often even against popular will .
the precise nature of the fights varies by company and region , including the tax and antitrust investigations of apple and google in europe and donald j. trump ’ s broad and often incoherent criticism of the five for various alleged misdeeds .
let ’ s start with some stats .
apple ’ s sales were flat last year , and after a monster 2016 , alphabet ’ s stock price hit a plateau .
the exceptions were microsoft , which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s , and amazon , which got under people ’ s skin for , among other things , making books cheaper and more widely accessible , thereby hurting bookstores .
but generally people loved tech giants .
they weren ’ t selling cigarettes .
when apple took on the federal bureau of investigation last year over access to a terrorist ’ s iphone , many in tech sided with the company , but a majority of americans thought apple should give in .
he promised to force apple to make iphones in america .
that ’ s where we are now .
details were sparse , and there were no clues to the gunman ’ s motives .
both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with mr. chen previously , but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing .
killings dropped to 79 in 2016 , from 129 in 2015 .
murders also fell , to 335 from 352 the year before .
the new york city police commissioner , james p. o ’ neill , has noted the department ’ s efforts to push shootings below 1 , 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s , when the police began keeping similar records .
” violent crime has been more persistent in some communities , especially outside manhattan .
murders on playgrounds climbed to 12 , from three the year before , and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles .
more broadly , murders indoors ticked up by 19 , while outdoor murders fell by 49 .
but he is no longer , by his own calculations , a member of the “ elite .
” as an adjective , the word “ elite ” still conveys something positive , even aspirational : elite athlete , elite model , elite travel services .
in this formulation , elites are a destructive , condescending collective , plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks .
the club for growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad , instructing the democrat howard dean to “ take his new york freak show back to vermont where it belongs .
“ i was on the right side of that issue , as you know , with the people , ” he boasted after brexit , adding that “ hillary , as always , stood with the elites .
but trump has also ventured beyond mere turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems : the “ people ” versus the “ elites .
the jacksonians rebelled against the founders ’ aristocratic pretensions .
” hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an “ elite .
as individuals , they might be republicans or democrats , and might live in ohio or california .
it was during bill clinton ’ s presidency that the social critic christopher lasch published “ the revolt of the elites and the betrayal of democracy , ” which mourned that “ liberals ” had turned into “ petulant , intolerant ” scolds , thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of middle america .
otherwise , the man in the white house will do it for them . ''

by a vote of 51 to 48 on wednesday , the senate took the first step , agreeing to take up a budget resolution , or blueprint , that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the law .
as republicans charged ahead , both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law , which has become deeply enmeshed with america ’ s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people .
he advised that republicans needed to “ be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster , ” and added , “ don ’ t let the schumer clowns out of this web .
” but as republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law , they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time .

“ and sometimes that takes a lot of hard work .

here is a primer .
q .
a .
in the senate , a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority .
for other bills , a majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote .
q .
why is it called reconciliation ?
a .
q .
a .
since 1980 , congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills .
twenty became law .
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the “ reagan revolution .
” it squeezed savings out of social security , medicare , medicaid , food stamps , the school lunch program , farm subsidies , student loans , welfare and jobless benefits , among many other programs .
congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill , the balanced budget act of 1997 .
that law also created the children ’ s health insurance program , primarily for uninsured children in families .
on the same day in 1997 , mr. clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes .
the bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by president george w. bush in 2001 and 2003 .
later , when republicans controlled both houses of congress , they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the affordable care act , but mr. obama vetoed the bill in january 2016 .
” q .
a .
senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours , so it can not be filibustered on the senate floor .
the senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the byrd rule , but the senate can waive the rule with a majority .
q .
what does this mean for the affordable care act ?
those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill mr. obama vetoed last january .

“ when you cut off the water , we dig for water .
” like most of syria ’ s problems , the damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war , which has killed hundreds of thousands of people , displaced about half the country ’ s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government , armed rebels and jihadist groups .
the crisis began on dec. 22 , when the water stopped flowing .

5 million people in damascus and the vicinity lack water , which has raised the risk of waterborne disease , especially among children , he said .
“ it has become our ultimate hope in damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine .
“ we want news about water and water supply schedules .
” despite the water crisis , conditions in damascus are far better than those in aleppo , the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country , where syrian and russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side .

kingsmill ’ s daughter , diana , who had a lifelong association with pacifist quakers , took over grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center , staging legendary games that recreated the infamous stanford prison experiment as a way to train the “ prisoners ” to fight oppression with noncooperation — a practice that ended after a disastrous fake “ invasion ” by a local biker gang retained for the purpose .
grindstone was full of kids like me : babies who attended alternative public schools in toronto , kingston and ottawa , who could rhyme the classic protest chant “ ” with the facility of lifelong practice .

why ?

when men take these jobs , they have more job security and wage growth than in work , according to recent research .

he lost several jobs , some because his employers took the work to china and mexico and others because the workers were replaced by robots .
he has heard the promises of jobs in the health care field : his daughter trained to be a medical technician .
“ i don ’ t want it to sound bad , but i ’ ve always seen a woman in the position of a nurse or some kind of health care worker .
i see it as more of a woman ’ s touch .
” also , health aides earn a median wage of $ 10 .
50 an hour .
women were hit harder than men by the decline in jobs , according to mr. autor .
yet when men , especially white men , enter fields , they are paid more and promoted faster than women , a phenomenon known as the glass escalator .
“ it ’ s not that they couldn ’ t become a health worker , it ’ s that people have backward views of what their identity is .
but they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time , while wages were stagnant .
technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician — requiring more training but not a college degree — paid 22 percent more than other jobs , after controlling for things like education .
they involve less interaction with patients and more with computers , so they are less stereotypically feminine .
there is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs , the study found .
black men were 3 .
3 times as likely as white men to take the health jobs , and other minority men were 1 .
8 times as likely .
white men were more likely to take the technical jobs .

apple removed both the and apps from the app store in china on dec. 23 .
“ for some time now the new york times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in china and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations , ” fred sainz , an apple spokesman , said of the times apps .
“ as a result , the app must be taken down off the china app store .
” mr. sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the times apps were said to have violated , who had contacted apple and when , and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented .
chinese law prohibits the publication of “ harmful information ” online , and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable .
apple has previously removed other , less prominent media apps from its china store .
apple ’ s chief executive , timothy d. cook , has said that the company complies with all local laws .
while in early 2016 apple resisted a court request in the united states for it to help federal officials unlock an iphone for a criminal investigation , mr. cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down .
in the end , the government was able to unlock the device without apple ’ ’ s help and the case was dropped .
farzana aslam , associate director of the center for comparative and public law at the university of hong kong , noted that in matters involving customer privacy , apple requires governments to submit subpoenas , search warrants or other legal documents .
on dec. 23 , david barboza , a times reporter , spoke with members of apple ’ s media team about the article .
mr. barboza had previously been in touch with the iphone factory owner , foxconn .
he had also contacted the chinese government as part of his reporting .
later that day , a separate team from apple informed the times that the apps would be removed , ms. murphy said .
the times news apps remain available in apple ’ s app stores for other countries , as well as the hong kong and taiwan stores , but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland china to download them .
apple ’ s decision to remove the app from its china store should not affect those who have already installed it .
in april , apple ’ s ibooks store and itunes movies were shut down in the country , just six months after they were introduced there .

but a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship — hailed at the time as the largest ever built , and praised for its professed unsinkability — may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to new york from southampton , england .
” mr. molony ’ s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in wiltshire , in southwest england , where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship ’ s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century .
about four years ago , a collaborator of mr. molony ’ s acquired the rare photographs of the ship , meticulously taken by harland and wolff ’ s engineering chief before it left a belfast shipyard .
mr. molony called the photographs “ the titanic equivalent of tutankhamen ’ s tomb , ” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed , including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage .
mr. molony contends that the ship ’ s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go , since delaying the ship ’ s journey would have been financially ruinous .
at the time of departure , the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea , away from the dock , and therefore concealed from passengers .
the titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories , among them that it was not the titanic that sank on april 15 , 1912 , but , rather the olympic , its sister ship that the titanic was torpedoed by a german or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an egyptian priestess ’ s mummy .
popularized by hollywood , the story of the titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture .
now the political editor at the irish daily mail , mr. molony , who has also written a book called “ the irish aboard titanic , ” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship , where cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of passengers , many of them irish , stayed below .
not everyone is convinced .
david hill , a former honorary secretary of the british titanic society , who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s , argued that , while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster , the blaze was not the decisive factor .
“ a fire may have accelerated this .
it was not the catastrophe at sea .

” mr. coats enjoys visiting restaurants both in indianapolis and in small hamlets that serve food , and featured several interesting restaurants and food purveyors when it was his turn to host lunch for his republican colleagues . ''
his message was brief , if alarming .
yared tamene , the contractor at the d. n. c. who fielded the call , was no expert in cyberattacks .
by his own account , he did not look too hard even after special agent hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks — in part because he wasn ’ t certain the caller was a real f. b. i. agent and not an impostor .
while there ’ s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack , this much is clear : a weapon that russia had in elections from ukraine to europe was trained on the united states , with devastating effectiveness .
“ there shouldn ’ t be any doubt in anybody ’ s mind , ” adm. michael s. rogers , the director of the national security agency and commander of united states cyber command , said at a postelection conference .
” the united states , too , has carried out cyberattacks , and in decades past the c. i .
a. tried to subvert foreign elections .
mr. tamene , who reports to mr. brown and fielded the call from the f. b. i. agent , was not a d. n. c. employee he works for a contracting firm called the mis department .
he was left to figure out , largely on his own , how to respond — and even whether the man who had called in to the d. n. c. switchboard was really an f. b. i. agent .
he added that “ the special agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed ‘ dukes ’ by the u. s. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles .
so when special agent hawkins called repeatedly in october , leaving voice mail messages for mr. tamene , urging him to call back , “ i did not return his calls , as i had nothing to report , ” mr. tamene explained in his memo .
in november , special agent hawkins called with more ominous news .
” mr. brown knew that mr. tamene , who declined to comment , was fielding calls from the f. b. i .
” “ this is not a delicatessen or a local library .
” the f. b. i. declined to comment on the agency ’ s handling of the hack .
but then the situation took a dire turn .
billy rinehart , a former d. n. c. regional field director who was then working for mrs. clinton ’ s campaign , got an odd email warning from google .
“ someone just used your password to try to sign into your google account , ” the march 22 email said , adding that the attempt had occurred in ukraine .
“ google stopped this attempt .
” mr. rinehart was in hawaii at the time .
they stole the designs for the fighter jet , corporate secrets for rolling steel , even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the united states .
but they didn ’ t publish any of it .
the russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes .
there was always a reason : fear of escalating a cyberwar , and concern that the united states needed russia ’ s cooperation in negotiations over syria .
but it didn ’ t happen .
last year , the attacks became more aggressive .
around christmas , it attacked part of the power grid in ukraine , dropping a portion of the country into darkness , killing backup generators and taking control of generators .
in retrospect , it was a warning shot .
“ the d. n. c. may have been hacked in a serious way this week , with password theft , etc .
a secret committee was immediately created , including ms. dacey , ms. wasserman schultz , mr. brown and michael sussmann , a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the department of justice who now works at perkins coie , the washington law firm that handles d. n. c. political matters .

how they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation ’ s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear .
nor is it yet evident that millions of americans with medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage .
whether they can meet that goal is unclear .
but that language has real teeth .
house republicans have some practice at this , because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law .
the committees — house energy and commerce , house ways and means , senate finance , and senate health , education , labor and pensions — will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law .
such bills can be adopted under special procedures .
so the legislation , as now conceived , would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact , such as the prohibition on insurers ’ denying coverage to people with conditions .
but a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode , leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before republicans have prepared a replacement .
â€ republican leadership officials in the house acknowledge the possibility of â€œ cascading effects â€ if the payments , which have totaled an estimated $ 13 billion , are suddenly stopped .
nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there .
in lobbies and family apartments , outside methadone clinics and art studios , people take note of the inequity .
they watch witnesses cower behind doors , more fearful of a gunman â€™ s crew than confident in the police department â€™ s ability to protect them .
so though people see a lot , they rarely testify .
and in the south bronx , as in so many predominantly black and hispanic neighborhoods like it in the united states , the contract between the police and the community is in tatters .
this is the paradox of policing in the 40th precinct .
but precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes .
that â€™ s how i feel .
in the chasm between the police and the community , gangs and gun violence flourish .
both are unsolved .
he lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles , empty dope bags and discarded hennessy bottles .
he chose the police .
â€œ there â€™ s a lot of killers here , and we are going to kill you , â€ a sergeant â€™ s police report quoted a telling mr. fernandez in august 2015 .
michael j. lopuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th precinct station house .
â€œ and people just don â€™ t understand that .
â€ often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police .
of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the bronx through early september , more than a third â€” 66 victims â€” refused to cooperate .
part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics , like that were a hallmark of the style under former mayor michael r. bloomberg and his police commissioner , raymond w. kelly .
of course that community â€™ s eventually going to turn on you .
rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop .
â€œ not because they wanted to , but because they had to .
â€ morale wilted in the aged station house on alexander avenue , in mott haven .
others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units , like that put them in situations on the street .
â€œ it was like a heaviness .
lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification .
several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response .
but the inspector acknowledged that the residue of policing lingers .
the workload in the 40th precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in manhattan compared with the bronx , brooklyn and queens .
by contrast , a detective in the precinct on the southern end of staten island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling union square and gramercy park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of washington heights handles 32 , the citywide median .
michael palladino , the head of the detectives â€™ endowment association and a former bronx officer , said staffing disparities affected the department â€™ s efforts to build trust in communities like the south bronx .
retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city â€™ s last â€œ â€ the busiest precincts .
â€œ the outer boroughs are , like , forgotten .
â€ the bronx â€™ s struggles extend into prosecutions .
they buy chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect .
they carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer .
they buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son â€™ s ashes in a box .
victims â€™ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance .
newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts , pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at police headquarters .
in a stuffy squad room , the detectives of the 40th precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect .
the mother started calling with tips under a code name â€” about a gun under a car , for example .

i have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger .
so he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family .
the man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down .

but what they did not know was that the film â€™ s striking appearance had been created by a chinese immigrant artist , who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the song dynasty .
in the years that followed , he endured poverty , discrimination and chronic lack of recognition , not only for his work at disney but also for his fine art , before finding acclaim in his 90s .
in 1932 and again in 1934 , his work was included in group shows at the art institute of chicago that also featured picasso , matisse and paul klee .
over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for disney and films for warner brothers and other studios , among them â€œ the sands of iwo jima â€ ( 1949 ) â€œ rebel without a cause â€ ( 1955 ) and â€œ the wild bunch â€ ( 1969 ) .

they were obliged to travel under false identities â€” a state of affairs known among chinese immigrants as being a â€œ paper son â€ â€” in the hope of circumventing the chinese exclusion act of 1882 .
signed into law by president chester a. arthur , the act , which drastically curtailed the number of chinese people allowed to enter the country , was among the earliest united states laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration .
as united states citizens , they were entitled to bring over their relatives â€” or , in the case of gen yeo and his father , â€œ paper sons â€ posing as relatives .
attuned to the deception , united states immigration officials put chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be .
where in the house is the rice bin ?
are there trees in your village ?
what shops can you name ?
the sponsoring relative was interrogated separately , and the answers had to match .
to stand a chance of passing , aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers .
the ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults .
on dec. 30 , 1920 , after a month at sea , the wongs landed at angel island immigration station .
â€ because mr. wong â€™ s father had previously lived in the united states as look get , he was able to clear immigration quickly .
but as a new arrival , gen yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month , the only child among the immigrants being held there .
i hated that place .

tyrus lived on his own in a sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school .
they lived in a boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel .
his first art teacher was his father , who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper : they could not afford ink or drawing paper .
by his own account an indifferent student in public school , tyrus found his calling at the institute , now the otis college of art and design .
his father scraped together the $ 90 tuition â€” a small fortune â€” to let him stay on as otis â€™ s youngest student .
not long afterward his father died , leaving young mr. wong entirely on his own .
in trying to animate the book , disney had reached an impasse .
mr. wong spied his chance .
â€™ â€ mr. wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist .
â€œ but he was more than that , â€ mr. canemaker explained .
the indignities he endured were not confined to the studios .
trying to buy a house , he and his wife , the former ruth kim , were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold .
â€œ then in a month you â€™ d go back there and the sign was still there , â€ mr. wong recalled in â€œ tyrus .
â€œ and that â€™ s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war .
â€ mr. wong , who became a united states citizen in 1946 , also designed christmas cards for hallmark and painted elegant designs on dinnerware , now sought after by collectors .
a longtime resident of sunland , calif. he became , in retirement , a renowned kitemaker , designing , building and hand coloring astonishing , airworthy creations â€” butterflies , swallows , whole flocks of owls , centipedes more than 100 feet long â€” that streaked the southern california sky like paint on blue canvas .
in 2001 , in formal recognition of his influence on â€œ bambi , â€ mr. wong was named a disney legend .
the disney family museum â€™ s retrospective , â€œ water to paper , paint to sky , â€ traveled in 2015 to the museum of chinese in america , in lower manhattan .
mr. wong â€™ s death , at his home in sunland , was confirmed by the filmmaker ms. tom .

despite spending billions of dollars on drugs and dieting programs , even the most motivated are working against their own biology .
but what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies , which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights , whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off .

if you want to start running each morning , it â€™ s essential that you choose a simple cue ( like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day ) and a clear reward ( like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles , or the endorphin rush you get from a jog ) .
but countless studies have shown that , at first , the rewards inherent in exercise aren â€™ t enough .
so to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward , you need to give yourself something you really enjoy â€” like a small piece of chocolate â€” after your workout .
but the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue ( â€œ it â€™ s 5 o â€™ clock â€ ) with a routine ( â€œ three miles down !
â€ ) and a reward ( â€œ chocolate !
â€ ) .
three miles down !
endorphin rush !
â€ ) and you won â€™ t need the chocolate anymore .
in fact , you won â€™ t even want it .
and then , over time , it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning .
you won â€™ t want the chocolate anymore .
you â€™ ll just crave the endorphins .

mr .

â€ if mr .
roof is sentenced to death , it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law , according to experts on capital cases .
that statute , which was broadened in 2009 , does not carry a potential death sentence , but mr .

roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and mr. roof â€™ s competence to stand trial and to represent himself .

nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there .
in lobbies and family apartments , outside methadone clinics and art studios , people take note of the inequity .
they watch witnesses cower behind doors , more fearful of a gunman â€™ s crew than confident in the police department â€™ s ability to protect them .
so though people see a lot , they rarely testify .
and in the south bronx , as in so many predominantly black and hispanic neighborhoods like it in the united states , the contract between the police and the community is in tatters .
this is the paradox of policing in the 40th precinct .
but precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes .
that â€™ s how i feel .
in the chasm between the police and the community , gangs and gun violence flourish .

â€ often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police .
of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the bronx through early september , more than a third â€” 66 victims â€” refused to cooperate .
part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics , like that were a hallmark of the style under former mayor michael r. bloomberg and his police commissioner , raymond w. kelly .
of course that community â€™ s eventually going to turn on you .
rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop .

but the inspector acknowledged that the residue of policing lingers .
the workload in the 40th precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in manhattan compared with the bronx , brooklyn and queens .
by contrast , a detective in the precinct on the southern end of staten island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling union square and gramercy park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of washington heights handles 32 , the citywide median .
michael palladino , the head of the detectives â€™ endowment association and a former bronx officer , said staffing disparities affected the department â€™ s efforts to build trust in communities like the south bronx .
retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city â€™ s last â€œ â€ the busiest precincts .
â€œ the outer boroughs are , like , forgotten .
â€ the bronx â€™ s struggles extend into prosecutions .
they buy chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect .
they carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer .
they buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son â€™ s ashes in a box .
victims â€™ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance .
newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts , pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at police headquarters .

but what they did not know was that the film â€™ s striking appearance had been created by a chinese immigrant artist , who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the song dynasty .
in the years that followed , he endured poverty , discrimination and chronic lack of recognition , not only for his work at disney but also for his fine art , before finding acclaim in his 90s .
in 1932 and again in 1934 , his work was included in group shows at the art institute of chicago that also featured picasso , matisse and paul klee .
over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for disney and films for warner brothers and other studios , among them â€œ the sands of iwo jima â€ ( 1949 ) â€œ rebel without a cause â€ ( 1955 ) and â€œ the wild bunch â€ ( 1969 ) .

they were obliged to travel under false identities â€” a state of affairs known among chinese immigrants as being a â€œ paper son â€ â€” in the hope of circumventing the chinese exclusion act of 1882 .
signed into law by president chester a. arthur , the act , which drastically curtailed the number of chinese people allowed to enter the country , was among the earliest united states laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration .
as united states citizens , they were entitled to bring over their relatives â€” or , in the case of gen yeo and his father , â€œ paper sons â€ posing as relatives .
attuned to the deception , united states immigration officials put chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be .
where in the house is the rice bin ?
are there trees in your village ?

the sponsoring relative was interrogated separately , and the answers had to match .
to stand a chance of passing , aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers .
the ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults .
on dec. 30 , 1920 , after a month at sea , the wongs landed at angel island immigration station .
â€ because mr. wong â€™ s father had previously lived in the united states as look get , he was able to clear immigration quickly .

tyrus lived on his own in a sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school .
they lived in a boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel .
his first art teacher was his father , who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper : they could not afford ink or drawing paper .
by his own account an indifferent student in public school , tyrus found his calling at the institute , now the otis college of art and design .
his father scraped together the $ 90 tuition â€” a small fortune â€” to let him stay on as otis â€™ s youngest student .
not long afterward his father died , leaving young mr. wong entirely on his own .
in trying to animate the book , disney had reached an impasse .
mr. wong spied his chance .
â€™ â€ mr. wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist .
â€œ but he was more than that , â€ mr. canemaker explained .
the indignities he endured were not confined to the studios .
trying to buy a house , he and his wife , the former ruth kim , were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold .
â€œ then in a month you â€™ d go back there and the sign was still there , â€ mr. wong recalled in â€œ tyrus .
â€œ and that â€™ s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war .
â€ mr. wong , who became a united states citizen in 1946 , also designed christmas cards for hallmark and painted elegant designs on dinnerware , now sought after by collectors .

they found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim , or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives .
if you want to start running each morning , it â€™ s essential that you choose a simple cue ( like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day ) and a clear reward ( like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles , or the endorphin rush you get from a jog ) .
but countless studies have shown that , at first , the rewards inherent in exercise aren â€™ t enough .
so to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward , you need to give yourself something you really enjoy â€” like a small piece of chocolate â€” after your workout .
but the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue ( â€œ it â€™ s 5 o â€™ clock â€ ) with a routine ( â€œ three miles down !
â€ ) and a reward ( â€œ chocolate !
â€ ) .
three miles down !
endorphin rush !

in fact , you won â€™ t even want it .
and then , over time , it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning .

mr .

â€ after receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in november , judge gergel found mr .

the judge has repeatedly warned mr .
roof against representing himself , including immediately after the verdicts , when he called it â€œ a bad decision â€ and urged him to â€œ fully appreciate the implications .

roof is sentenced to death , it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law , according to experts on capital cases .
that statute , which was broadened in 2009 , does not carry a potential death sentence , but mr .
roof was also convicted of other crimes that do .
roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and mr. roof â€™ s competence to stand trial and to represent himself .

although mr. obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30 , 000 additional troops to afghanistan , he placed a strict timetable on the mission , saying they would have to be withdrawn again , starting in july 2011 .
was it simply to prevent afghanistan from being a safe haven for al qaeda ?
or was it to turn afghanistan into another denmark ?
â€œ but what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define .
mr. obama listened for a while , then cut him off .
â€œ it can win wars and stabilize conflicts .
â€œ the goal i set â€” to defeat al qaeda , and deny it a chance to rebuild â€” is now within our reach .
â€ earlier , mr. obama had met for an hour with mr. karzai .
he concluded that without the right partner , it was impossible for the united states to succeed , no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country .
he was , he conceded , a â€œ broken record â€ on this issue .
the 10 , 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular , ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control .
mr. obama liked that idea .
in the interview in september , he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed .
they were training and assisting afghan troops , even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry .

mr. netanyahu , who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges , has vehemently denied any impropriety .
â€ â€œ hold off the celebrations don â€™ t rush , â€ he added .

â€ israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation , unless they are charged with a crime .
the inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture â€” the netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister â€™ s official residence with an identical , old set in their private home in caesarea â€” to a more recent one involving a deal with germany for the acquisition of submarines .
that agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that mr. netanyahu â€™ s personal lawyer also represents the israeli agent of the german shipyard that builds the submarines , and other naval equipment purchased by israel , giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest .
but it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time , and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer â€™ s demands intrude on evenings at home , treasured vacations or sundays with friends and family .

the office of congressional ethics refused to shut down its inquiry , and it published its findings on its own after the ethics committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing ( although the committee urged them to return the gifts ) .

on a day usually reserved for pomp , constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses , congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles .
as democrats in both chambers seethed , senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the affordable care act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring , even if any replacement of the law could take years .
under arcane budget procedures , that legislation would be protected from a democratic filibuster and could pass the senate with a simple majority .
that provoked an outcry from both democrats and voters who flooded house offices with angry calls .

â€ on tuesday , the house also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law .
the document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved .
nor does it specify or even suggest how republicans would replace the affordable care act , which the obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured .
republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill , to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law .

israel â€™ s defense minister , avigdor lieberman , called wednesday â€™ s decision â€œ a tough verdict .
â€ mr. lieberman , as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment , had attended the military court to support sergeant azaria and called the legal proceedings a â€œ theater of the absurd .
now , some fear that in the lower ranks , it has begun to erode .
video footage showed sergeant azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause , and he was embraced by his family and friends .
hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound , shouting slogans like â€œ free the boy .
local television stations frequently showed images of sergeant azaria â€™ s distraught parents hugging him in court .
appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism , and where most jewish are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service , his supporters portrayed him as â€œ everybody â€™ s child .

in a brief interview , mr .
that show will be in the vein of cbs â€™ s â€œ 60 minutes , â€ where mr .
lack worked early in his career .
â€ yet the move has its risks for all involved , especially the daytime program .
in an interview with charlie rose on â€œ cbs sunday morning â€ last year , ms. kelly described the television show of her fantasies .
wouldn â€™ t you watch that ? â€ ms. kelly kept a relatively low profile on tuesday , addressing her own news at the end of that night â€™ s edition of â€œ the kelly file .
her last show on fox is on friday . ''
ms. kelly , 46 , will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years .
ms. kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch .
a daily daytime talk show also poses risks .
â€ the audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than fox â€™ s viewership .
starting a sunday rival to â€œ 60 minutes , â€ the among newsmagazines , is likewise no easy task .
nbc â€™ s most recent newsmagazine , â€œ on assignment , â€ ran against â€œ 60 minutes â€ over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers , compared with more than nine million for â€œ 60 minutes , â€ which broadcast two repeats during that time .
( this season , â€œ 60 minutes â€ is averaging more than 14 million viewers . )
it is also unclear how nbc will accommodate ms. kelly â€™ s show during the national football league season , when nbc â€™ s popular â€œ sunday night football â€ package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. eastern .
lack presided over nbc in the 1990s when newsmagazines , including the network â€™ s popular â€œ dateline , â€ dominated lineups .
when greta van susteren , another veteran anchor , announced her departure in september , network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in .

but when it gets down to the level in the provinces , it â€™ s like people doing their own thing .
â€œ just not so blatantly .
in september , he revisited his old school in beijing , where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game , according to memoirs of his former teacher .
â€œ i laid the basis for that through sports when i was young .
in the main pro trading season last year , the 16 chinese super league teams spent about $ 300 million hiring away promising foreign players , outstripping player spending by the english premier league by nearly $ 120 million , according to fifa tms , a player transfer data company .
â€œ that was unthinkable before .
but even here , the children come to the game later than their european and south american counterparts , and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics , said sergio zarco diaz , a spanish coach .
some schools , facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields , have devised their own drills , like soccer gymnastics , in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up , down and around .
it may impress visiting officials , but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game , said zhang lu , a widely respected soccer commentator .
on a recent afternoon , the smog that often covers beijing lifted and the children of caoqiao elementary school rushed onto the fields , shouting and squealing with delight .
â€œ but at midday i notified the kids that it was back on , and they all went crazy with relief .
â€ ''
that worries lawmakers .
the dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom .
nearly a year ago , i argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business , one that is typified less by the storied in a garage than by a posse i like to call the frightful five : amazon , apple , facebook , microsoft and alphabet , google â€™ s parent company .
in the united states , europe , asia and south america , the five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers , and often even against popular will .
the precise nature of the fights varies by company and region , including the tax and antitrust investigations of apple and google in europe and donald j. trump â€™ s broad and often incoherent criticism of the five for various alleged misdeeds .
let â€™ s start with some stats .
apple â€™ s sales were flat last year , and after a monster 2016 , alphabet â€™ s stock price hit a plateau .
the exceptions were microsoft , which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s , and amazon , which got under people â€™ s skin for , among other things , making books cheaper and more widely accessible , thereby hurting bookstores .
but generally people loved tech giants .
they weren â€™ t selling cigarettes .
when apple took on the federal bureau of investigation last year over access to a terrorist â€™ s iphone , many in tech sided with the company , but a majority of americans thought apple should give in .
he promised to force apple to make iphones in america .
that â€™ s where we are now .
details were sparse , and there were no clues to the gunman â€™ s motives .
both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with mr. chen previously , but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing .
killings dropped to 79 in 2016 , from 129 in 2015 .
murders also fell , to 335 from 352 the year before .
the new york city police commissioner , james p. o â€™ neill , has noted the department â€™ s efforts to push shootings below 1 , 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s , when the police began keeping similar records .
â€ violent crime has been more persistent in some communities , especially outside manhattan .
murders on playgrounds climbed to 12 , from three the year before , and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles .
more broadly , murders indoors ticked up by 19 , while outdoor murders fell by 49 .
but he is no longer , by his own calculations , a member of the â€œ elite .
â€ as an adjective , the word â€œ elite â€ still conveys something positive , even aspirational : elite athlete , elite model , elite travel services .
in this formulation , elites are a destructive , condescending collective , plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks .
the club for growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad , instructing the democrat howard dean to â€œ take his new york freak show back to vermont where it belongs .
â€œ i was on the right side of that issue , as you know , with the people , â€ he boasted after brexit , adding that â€œ hillary , as always , stood with the elites .
but trump has also ventured beyond mere turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems : the â€œ people â€ versus the â€œ elites .
the jacksonians rebelled against the founders â€™ aristocratic pretensions .
â€ hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an â€œ elite .
as individuals , they might be republicans or democrats , and might live in ohio or california .
it was during bill clinton â€™ s presidency that the social critic christopher lasch published â€œ the revolt of the elites and the betrayal of democracy , â€ which mourned that â€œ liberals â€ had turned into â€œ petulant , intolerant â€ scolds , thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of middle america .

in the senate , a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority .
for other bills , a majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote .
q .
why is it called reconciliation ?
a .
q .
a .
since 1980 , congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills .
twenty became law .
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the â€œ reagan revolution .
â€ it squeezed savings out of social security , medicare , medicaid , food stamps , the school lunch program , farm subsidies , student loans , welfare and jobless benefits , among many other programs .
congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill , the balanced budget act of 1997 .
that law also created the children â€™ s health insurance program , primarily for uninsured children in families .
on the same day in 1997 , mr. clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes .
the bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by president george w. bush in 2001 and 2003 .
later , when republicans controlled both houses of congress , they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the affordable care act , but mr. obama vetoed the bill in january 2016 .
â€ q .

â€œ when you cut off the water , we dig for water .
â€ like most of syria â€™ s problems , the damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war , which has killed hundreds of thousands of people , displaced about half the country â€™ s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government , armed rebels and jihadist groups .

we set out in her car , exploring the of vancouver island , heading for the northern tip , port hardy .

kingsmill â€™ s daughter , diana , who had a lifelong association with pacifist quakers , took over grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center , staging legendary games that recreated the infamous stanford prison experiment as a way to train the â€œ prisoners â€ to fight oppression with noncooperation â€” a practice that ended after a disastrous fake â€œ invasion â€ by a local biker gang retained for the purpose .
grindstone was full of kids like me : babies who attended alternative public schools in toronto , kingston and ottawa , who could rhyme the classic protest chant â€œ â€ with the facility of lifelong practice .

the jobs that have been disappearing , like machine operator , are predominantly those that men do .
why ?
of the jobs , many are various types of health aides , which are about 90 percent female .
when men take these jobs , they have more job security and wage growth than in work , according to recent research .
i â€™ m very worried about whether there will be jobs for adults , especially the males , who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs .

i see it as more of a woman â€™ s touch .
â€ also , health aides earn a median wage of $ 10 .
50 an hour .
women were hit harder than men by the decline in jobs , according to mr. autor .
yet when men , especially white men , enter fields , they are paid more and promoted faster than women , a phenomenon known as the glass escalator .
â€œ it â€™ s not that they couldn â€™ t become a health worker , it â€™ s that people have backward views of what their identity is .
but they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time , while wages were stagnant .
technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician â€” requiring more training but not a college degree â€” paid 22 percent more than other jobs , after controlling for things like education .
they involve less interaction with patients and more with computers , so they are less stereotypically feminine .
there is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs , the study found .
black men were 3 .
3 times as likely as white men to take the health jobs , and other minority men were 1 .
8 times as likely .
white men were more likely to take the technical jobs .

apple removed both the and apps from the app store in china on dec. 23 .
â€œ for some time now the new york times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in china and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations , â€ fred sainz , an apple spokesman , said of the times apps .
â€œ as a result , the app must be taken down off the china app store .
â€ mr. sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the times apps were said to have violated , who had contacted apple and when , and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented .
chinese law prohibits the publication of â€œ harmful information â€ online , and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable .
apple has previously removed other , less prominent media apps from its china store .
apple â€™ s chief executive , timothy d. cook , has said that the company complies with all local laws .
while in early 2016 apple resisted a court request in the united states for it to help federal officials unlock an iphone for a criminal investigation , mr. cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down .
in the end , the government was able to unlock the device without apple â€™ â€™ s help and the case was dropped .
farzana aslam , associate director of the center for comparative and public law at the university of hong kong , noted that in matters involving customer privacy , apple requires governments to submit subpoenas , search warrants or other legal documents .
on dec. 23 , david barboza , a times reporter , spoke with members of apple â€™ s media team about the article .
mr. barboza had previously been in touch with the iphone factory owner , foxconn .
he had also contacted the chinese government as part of his reporting .

80,17378 , '' coal fire , not just iceberg , doomed the titanic , a journalist claims - the new york times '' , new york times , dan bilefsky,2017-01-04,2017.0,1.0 , , '' london â€” maybe it wasn â€™ t just the iceberg .
but a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship â€” hailed at the time as the largest ever built , and praised for its professed unsinkability â€” may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to new york from southampton , england .
â€ mr. molony â€™ s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in wiltshire , in southwest england , where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship â€™ s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century .
about four years ago , a collaborator of mr. molony â€™ s acquired the rare photographs of the ship , meticulously taken by harland and wolff â€™ s engineering chief before it left a belfast shipyard .
mr. molony called the photographs â€œ the titanic equivalent of tutankhamen â€™ s tomb , â€ because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed , including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage .
mr. molony contends that the ship â€™ s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go , since delaying the ship â€™ s journey would have been financially ruinous .
at the time of departure , the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea , away from the dock , and therefore concealed from passengers .
the titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories , among them that it was not the titanic that sank on april 15 , 1912 , but , rather the olympic , its sister ship that the titanic was torpedoed by a german or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an egyptian priestess â€™ s mummy .
popularized by hollywood , the story of the titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture .
now the political editor at the irish daily mail , mr. molony , who has also written a book called â€œ the irish aboard titanic , â€ was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship , where cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of passengers , many of them irish , stayed below .
not everyone is convinced .
david hill , a former honorary secretary of the british titanic society , who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s , argued that , while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster , the blaze was not the decisive factor .
â€œ a fire may have accelerated this .
it was not the catastrophe at sea .

his message was brief , if alarming .
yared tamene , the contractor at the d. n. c. who fielded the call , was no expert in cyberattacks .
by his own account , he did not look too hard even after special agent hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks â€” in part because he wasn â€™ t certain the caller was a real f. b. i. agent and not an impostor .
while there â€™ s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack , this much is clear : a weapon that russia had in elections from ukraine to europe was trained on the united states , with devastating effectiveness .
â€œ there shouldn â€™ t be any doubt in anybody â€™ s mind , â€ adm. michael s. rogers , the director of the national security agency and commander of united states cyber command , said at a postelection conference .
â€ the united states , too , has carried out cyberattacks , and in decades past the c. i .
a. tried to subvert foreign elections .
mr. tamene , who reports to mr. brown and fielded the call from the f. b. i. agent , was not a d. n. c. employee he works for a contracting firm called the mis department .
he was left to figure out , largely on his own , how to respond â€” and even whether the man who had called in to the d. n. c. switchboard was really an f. b. i. agent .
he added that â€œ the special agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed â€˜ dukes â€™ by the u. s. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles .
so when special agent hawkins called repeatedly in october , leaving voice mail messages for mr. tamene , urging him to call back , â€œ i did not return his calls , as i had nothing to report , â€ mr. tamene explained in his memo .

they stole the designs for the fighter jet , corporate secrets for rolling steel , even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the united states .
but they didn â€™ t publish any of it .
the russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes .
there was always a reason : fear of escalating a cyberwar , and concern that the united states needed russia â€™ s cooperation in negotiations over syria .
but it didn â€™ t happen .
last year , the attacks became more aggressive .
around christmas , it attacked part of the power grid in ukraine , dropping a portion of the country into darkness , killing backup generators and taking control of generators .
in retrospect , it was a warning shot .
â€œ the d. n. c. may have been hacked in a serious way this week , with password theft , etc .

fancy bear , sometimes called a. p. t. 28 and believed to be directed by the g. r. u. russia â€™ s military intelligence agency , is an older outfit , tracked by western investigators for nearly a decade .
attribution , as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known , is more art than science .
it is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty .
another clue : the russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the moscow time zone .
and we did not yet know what they had taken .
there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty .

â€ computer experts drew the same conclusion about dcleaks .
for republican operatives , it was insider gold .
â€œ but they wanted to hurt her .

in argentina , omar graffigna , the former chief of the country â€™ s air force , was sentenced to prison in september for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two activists , patricia roisinblit and josÃ© manuel pÃ©rez rojo .

how they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation â€™ s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear .
nor is it yet evident that millions of americans with medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage .
whether they can meet that goal is unclear .
but that language has real teeth .
house republicans have some practice at this , because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law .
the committees â€” house energy and commerce , house ways and means , senate finance , and senate health , education , labor and pensions â€” will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law .
such bills can be adopted under special procedures .
so the legislation , as now conceived , would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact , such as the prohibition on insurers â€™ denying coverage to people with conditions .
â–  eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for medicaid .
republicans have not said for sure which taxes they will scrap and which they may keep .
some may undo obama administration policies .
at the moment , they have no consensus .
mr. trump has also endorsed the idea of â€œ pools â€ for people with conditions who would otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage .
without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance , and without subsidies to buy it , supporters of the law say many healthy people would go without coverage , knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it .
the directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors , who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school , the diplomats said .
they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter .
it instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications .
bill clinton , george w. bush and mr. obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors .
â€ ''
â€œ the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginning .
â€œ instead of calling names , â€ mr. schumer said at a news conference on capitol hill , mr. trump â€œ should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million americans who gained coverage , that will cover students or students , 21 to 26 , who want to stay on their parents â€™ plan , that will show how we cover people with conditions .

to resolve the case , mr. corzine has agreed to pay the $ 5 million penalty out of his own pocket .
in other federal cases involving wall street , insurance money often covers settlement amounts , sparing the executives themselves .
while mr. corzine was willing to settle the case , ms. o â€™ brien nearly took it to trial .
during negotiations with mr. corzine last year , the commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agency â€™ s commissioners questioned it , the new york times reported at the time .
although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for mf global , and the european bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt , it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes .
and after a series of ratings downgrades , the firm started to unravel .
according to court records submitted by his lawyers , mr. corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy , after the breach had happened .

but on thursday , the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position , including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $ 1 billion through a $ 500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from mr. lampert â€™ s hedge fund .
stanley black decker will be able to sell craftsman tools in even more outlets .
today , only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside sears stores .
â€ reaching the deal took months , as mr. loree acknowledged on the analyst call .
last spring , sears announced that it had hired the banks citigroup and liontree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its brands , including craftsman , diehard and kenmore , to raise money .
but after the company and its bankers at deutsche bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid , stanley black decker turned its eyes toward buying newell brands â€™ tool business , a deal announced in october .
by late fall , however , sears returned to ask if stanley black decker would reconsider a bid for craftsman .
under the deal , stanley black decker will pay $ 525 million when the transaction closes , which is expected to occur by and an additional $ 250 million at the end of the third year after closing .
the transaction is now valued at $ 900 million .

train that crashed was going over twice speed limit , inquiry finds - the new york times '' , new york times , emma g. fitzsimmons,2017-01-06,2017.0,1.0 , , '' a long island rail road train that crashed in brooklyn on wednesday was going more than twice the speed limit when it slammed into a train station , injuring more than 100 people , federal investigators said on thursday .

â€œ we are hearing a lot of different things about border tariffs and regulatory policies , but we don â€™ t know what the whole picture looks like .
that is partly because of a sustained slump in sales of small and midsize cars , which has offset the increased demand for trucks and s. u. v. s. but it forces automakers to rely on discounts to sell less popular models , adjust production plans on the fly and lay off workers at some of their factories .

100,17399 , what to watch for in fashion in 2017 - the new york times , new york times , vanessa friedman,2017-01-09,2017.0,1.0 , , '' so , the sparkly dresses and heat tech have been worn the ball , and the other shoe , has dropped .
it â€™ s no longer time to look back , but to look forward .
and what do we see ?
when it comes to fashion â€” or more important , fashion as it affects life â€” there will be interesting times ahead .
here are some opening thoughts on what to watch for in the coming months .
pantsuits â€” at least on women â€” are out .
in washington , we are entering the era of the boxy , oversize suit , the big knot , the tie , and , maybe , european brands .
the inauguration this month will throw down the gauntlet .
what the will wear ( brioni is my best guess ) may ultimately be less significant than what his wife and eldest daughter will wear .
and previously , when stumping for her father , if not in her own brand , ivanka opted for roland mouret and alexander mcqueen .
in france , where voters go to the polls in april and may , a candidate , franÃ§ois fillon , is known for combining savile row tailoring and italian style , as well as for his fondness of red socks from gammarelli ( official tailor to the pope ) .
also on the runways .
more upheaval on the runways .
think of it as the bandwagon of the sexes .
and more cultural action off the runways .
in february , in the middle of fashion month , kensington palace in london will host â€œ diana : her fashion story , â€ a collection of garments worn by the princess in the 1980s and â€™ 90s .
in july , just before the couture shows kick off , the musÃ©e des arts dÃ©coratifs in paris will present â€œ christian dior .
â€ and in between those two openings , three major retrospectives will be unveiled in may : â€œ balenciaga : shaping fashion , â€ at the victoria and albert museum in london â€œ the world of anna sui , â€ at the fashion and textile museum in london ( the first retrospective of an american designer to be held in britain ) and , of course , â€œ rei des garÃ§ons â€ at the metropolitan museum of art â€™ s costume institute .
then there are the movies .
jack o â€™ connell has been signed to play alexander mcqueen in andrew haigh â€™ s movie on the british designer , which is set to start filming in the spring daniel will channel charles james for paul thomas anderson â€™ s movie about the couturier , who was the subject of a met show in 2014 and on the small screen , lady gaga will be donatella versace in â€œ : american crime story , â€ the third season of the fx television drama .
reviews , and box offices , will tell .
pun intended . ''
perhaps their living preferences have shifted .
their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities , falling crime has a comparable effect , spurring gentrification .
â€ nationally , violent crime peaked in 1991 .
that may reflect the fact , ms. ellen suggested , that families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime .
or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have .

instead , when asked by a judge , â€œ why do you do all this ? â€ mr. herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of france â€™ s practice of rounding up and turning back africans entering illegally from italy in search of work and a better life .
â€œ there are people dying on the side of the road , â€ mr. herrou replied .
â€œ it â€™ s not right .
there are children who are not safe .
it is enraging to see children , at 2 in the morning , completely dehydrated .
â€œ i am a frenchman , â€ mr. herrou declared .
it has been substantially covered by the french news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of france â€™ s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into europe and the quandary they present .
france , foremost among european nations , prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism , fraternity and solidarity .
others in this region seem to agree .
â€œ long live the righteous of the roya , â€ read another .
remember the last word in the french republic â€™ s motto , â€œ libertÃ© , egalitÃ© , fraternitÃ© , â€ his lawyer , zia oloumi , told the court .
he was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard the roya valley had become a way station for migrants .
the judges did not respond .
but the lightness of the sentence called for by mr. prÃªtre suggested that the concepts invoked by mr. oloumi had resonance .
mr. herrou â€™ s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness .
not every migrant mr. herrou picks up is by the side of the road .
at that time , the prosecutor released him , suggesting that mr. herrou â€™ s humanitarian motivations absolved him .
no matter .
mr. herrou persisted , describing his work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed .
â€ the judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time mr. herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously .
the local political establishment is furious with him .
mr. prÃªtre , the prosecutor , suggested that mr. herrou â€™ s persistence and openness had been his undoing .

his remaining personal net worth is slightly more than $ 2 million .

still , most of the people actually buying and selling bitcoin these days are coming from a single country : china .
in bitcoin â€™ s case , the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million bitcoin will ever be created .
some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that bitcoin uses .
new bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the bitcoin network , and previously released bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world .
the only other time the price of bitcoin has exceeded $ 1 , 000 was in late 2013 , when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from chinese investors and traders .
the bitcoin price fell to its low â€” under $ 200 â€” in early 2015 .

111,17412 , russia requires apple and google to remove linkedin from local app stores - the new york times , new york times , cecilia kang and katie benner,2017-01-07,2017.0,1.0 , , '' washington â€” smartphone users in russia can no longer download the linkedin app on iphone or android devices , following a similar move in china to block the new york times app on iphones .
the demand by russian authorities to remove linkedin in apple and google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on russian citizens within the nation â€™ s borders .
the action is the equivalent of a nation banning â€œ catcher in the rye â€ and then forcing booksellers to remove the title from their shelves .
it puts apple and google in a difficult position .
removing them from the google play store and apple â€™ s app store may not have cut off access to content , but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps .
but civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on apple and google is a new wrinkle .
in the early 2000s , american internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by china to comply with censorship rules within the country â€™ s internet controls , known as the great firewall .
linkedin , which is owned by microsoft , said it was â€œ disappointed â€ with the decision by russian regulators to block the service , which the company confirmed was extended to apps in russian apple and google play stores .
apple confirmed it was asked to remove its linkedin app in russia about a month ago .
european nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like google unlink information about users upon request .
â€œ it appears to be a ratchet with speech control getting tighter .
in november , a russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on russian accounts within the nation .
the russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment .

weeks later , the regulator discovered that its database containing the private medical information of international athletes had been breached .
a group identifying itself as fancy bear â€” a russian cyberespionage group that forensics experts had tied to the russian government â€” published the records of athletes who had received special clearance to take typically banned substances for medical reasons .
regulators and olympic officials have repeatedly defended the affected athletes , noting that they followed proper procedure and received formal clearance .

113,17414 , trump nominees â€™ filings threaten to overwhelm federal ethics office - the new york times , new york times , eric lipton and steve eder,2017-01-07,2017.0,1.0 , , '' washington â€” rex w. tillerson owns more than $ 50 million of exxon mobil stock , has earned an annual salary of $ 10 million and holds a range of positions â€” from director at the boy scouts of america to the managing director of a texas horse and cattle ranch .
but mr. tillerson is prepared to resign from all those posts , sell all his stock and put much of his money into bland investments like treasury bonds if he becomes secretary of state , according to an â€œ ethics undertakings â€ memo he filed this week with the state department .
and , if he returns to the oil industry in the next decade , he could lose as much as $ 180 million .
mr. tillerson is worth at least $ 300 million , but is hardly the richest among them : wilbur l. ross jr. the commerce secretary nominee betsy devos , the education secretary nominee and steven t. mnuchin , the treasury secretary nominee , each hold assets estimated at more than a billion dollars .
â€œ they are having some difficulty keeping up .
at the same time , this class of wealthy incoming officials could save hundreds of millions of dollars in income tax payments , thanks to a special tax benefit created so that affluent americans do not avoid federal government jobs .
this is partly a reflection of the extraordinary complexity of negotiating such conflict of interest agreements for incoming government officials worth hundreds of millions , or even billions , of dollars .
â€œ he has wilbur ross , who is probably involved in a gazillion different things .
for appointees like mr. tillerson , the transition to government can have lucrative benefits : they can take advantage of measures in the tax code meant to be an incentive for wealthy people to consider public service jobs .
this tax benefit , which requires approval by the office of government ethics , allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on certain assets that they must sell in order to clear potential conflicts as they take office â€” essentially providing them with loans .
to gain the tax advantage , the liquidated proceeds must then be invested in treasury bonds , mutual funds or funds , and the official must seek a certificate of divestiture .
in 2006 , mr. paulson left goldman sachs and sold an estimated $ 500 million in goldman stock , deferring taxes on the sale .
but a more complicated task involved resolving the fate of two million shares of exxon mobil stock , worth about $ 180 million , that mr. tillerson was set to receive over the next decade .
so exxon mobil agreed to take the unusual step of paying out the value of these sales and putting the money into an independent trust , with the money invested in neutral assets like treasury bonds and mutual funds .

among fitness scientists , these people are known as â€œ nonresponders .
â€ their bodies simply don â€™ t respond to the exercise they are doing .
and once discouraged , they often return to being nonexercisers .
but when the researchers examined individual outcomes , the variations were staggering .
age , sex and ethnicity had not mattered , the researchers noted .
young people and old had been outliers , as had women and men , black volunteers and white .
and a study published last year concentrating on brief bouts of intense interval training concluded that some people barely gained endurance with this type of workout , while others flourished , greatly augmenting their fitness .
each volunteer completed eight intervals of very hard pedaling on a stationary bicycle , with 10 seconds of rest after each bout .
the intervals were brutal but brief .
as a group , they had gained admirable amounts of fitness from both workouts and to about the same extent .
then check your pulse .
walk .
jog .
attend interval training or spin classes .
your pulse rate should be slower now .
your workout sessions should also be feeling easier .
if not , you may be a nonresponder to your current exercise routine .
in that case , switch things up , dr. gurd recommends .

the ad was indeed a hoax , and readers who realized this have asked the times to address the issue .

but i â€™ m only speaking for myself , not the paper .

128,17430 , dozens of inmates killed as prison violence escalates in brazil - the new york times , new york times , simon romero,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0 , , '' rio de janeiro â€” some of the inmates were beheaded .
others had their hearts torn from their bodies .
â€œ and now the horror is spreading .
â€ prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in brazil .
in 2006 , street fighting between the police and first capital command , a gang , left almost 200 people dead in sÃ£o paulo , causing chaos in the city of 20 million people .
the violence at the monte cristo agricultural penitentiary in boa vista , the capital of roraima , adds to fears about an intensifying war between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the amazon region in brazil .
the latest episode is thought to involve fighting between first capital command , commonly known by its portuguese initials , p. c. c. which has roots in the prisons of sÃ£o paulo in southeastern brazil , and supporters of red command , a drug trafficking organization that has long held sway in rio de janeiro .
family of the north , an increasingly influential gang in the amazon that has allied itself with red command , was responsible for the attack at the prison in manaus , massacring dozens of rivals from the p. c. c. gang .
just months after emerging victorious in the battle to impeach his predecessor , dilma rousseff , mr. temer is grappling with calls from some of his own allies to resign .
the prison was built for 700 inmates but currently holds about 1 , 400 .
carlos paixÃ£o de oliveira , a prosecutor in roraima , publicly criticized the management of the facility in october , when inmates from the p. c. c. gang killed at least 10 rivals from red command .
mr. oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced .
â€œ we think this had to do with an internal battle .
human rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in sÃ£o paulo , when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates .
brazil now has a prison population exceeding half a million , with about 40 percent of detainees awaiting trial .
â€ indeed , some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by voters .
the current government is also not backing a shorter workweek .
french unions defend the measure as protecting workers from employers who might otherwise return to more onerous workplace conditions .
amazon , google and deloitte recently began experiments to compress the week into four days for some employees .
the bigger issue , mr. bernmar argues , is whether policy makers are willing to explore a connection between human happiness and health and productivity .
the question , mr. bernmar added , was â€œ should we work to live , not live to work ? â€ ''

the card has a $ 450 annual fee , but it gives back $ 300 of it each year once you purchase at least that amount in travel .
it also gives out a generous amount of points â€” three per dollar spent â€” on travel and dining .
so should you take advantage of it while you can ?
my wife and i both have done it and are glad we did .
this feeling of superiority may be delusional , given the amount of research that suggests that we pay more when we put things on plastic than when we pay with cash .
in our household , we are reserving judgment .
that is ( in part ) because starwood is in the middle of being acquired by marriott , which faces the challenging task of combining two loyalty programs without driving away frequent travelers .

she noticed his kindness toward her friends .
â€œ they really took care of me .
â€ mr. williams was arrested in 2011 .
that october , the couple married at the rikers island jail complex .
â€œ i was not happy at all .
â€ mrs. williams , alone raising their son , had limited career options .
when she became pregnant , she dropped out of high school and thought that mr. williams would provide for the family .
â€œ instead , i have to start all over in my life .
she has a temporary job at a postal office in flushing , queens .
she feels guilty whenever she has to leave tyrell in the care of her sisters or godparents when heading off to school or work , especially at times where he pleads with her not to leave him like daddy did .
â€œ â€˜ i â€™ m doing this so you can have your own room , you can have this , you can have that. â€™ i don â€™ t know if he â€™ s too young to understand , but i know he â€™ ll eventually understand .

â€ once every few months , mrs. williams and tyrell jr. travel by bus , to the clinton correctional facility to visit mr. williams .
the family spent some time in syracuse while mr. williams was awaiting trial .

russia and the united states have also often been at odds over moscow â€™ s involvement in the war in syria .
he also seemingly conceded russian involvement in the election , but he has taken pains to point out that there is no evidence that any vote tallies were altered , apparently seeking to avoid the suggestion that his victory was illegitimate .

but he is likely to face blistering questions from democrats who are concerned about his civil rights record .
in the 1980s , racially charged accusations derailed his nomination to a federal judgeship .
republicans are indignant .
but it was not until early november , when he walked into an f. b. i. office carrying an ammunition clip â€” leaving a pistol and his infant son in his car â€” to complain about a c. i .
a. plot against him , that his behavior became disturbing enough to earn him a short stay in a psychiatric hospital unit .
in the months before , the police were called repeatedly to his home about domestic disturbances , and the national guard kicked him out because of â€œ unsatisfactory performance â€ after nearly a decade of service .
late saturday afternoon , the united states attorney for the southern district of florida announced that mr. santiago had been arrested and charged on a federal criminal complaint â€œ in connection with the deadly shooting of multiple victims at fort international airport .
â€œ it â€™ s way too early for us to really rule out anything , â€ george piro , the agent in charge of the f. b. i .
esteban santiago lived in anchorage , and bryan santiago said he had visited him there , most recently staying with him from august through october .
a. controlled him through secret messages over the internet and told him the things he had to do , â€ he recalled .
a. put terrorist propaganda on his computer .
f. b. i. agents called the local police , who took him to a psychiatric facility .
in 2010 , mr. santiago was deployed to iraq for nine months , working with the 130th engineer battalion clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges , according to the alaska army national guard .
â€ he described his nephew as a â€œ normal kid â€ who enjoyed reading .
a month later , he was charged with violating a court order to stay away from his girlfriend after the police found that he had been living with her again .
in march , a deferred judgment was entered in the case , meaning that it could be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble , but the signs of unrest continued .
â€ despite the disturbing nature of the episode with the f. b. i. in november , it did not land mr. santiago on any law enforcement watch lists or on the federal â€œ â€ list .
neither did it impede his right to possess a gun .
â€ while people who knew mr. santiago recently saw anger , instability and paranoia , those who knew him earlier in his life had known someone very different .
relatives and acquaintances in puerto rico remembered him as being quiet and shy â€” so reserved that in his hometown , peÃ±uelas , on the island â€™ s southwest coast , few people knew anything about him .
i saw horrible things , horrible. â€™ he was very different .
he was sad .
â€œ he participated in classes and all that , but he was pretty shy .
mr. santiago and his friends were â€œ never known to be involved in any problem or any fight during the whole time we were in school , â€ mr. ortiz said .
â€ ''
if there â€™ s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon , it is that .
now , the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived .
and it may turn out to be a very big deal , particularly if a tax plan that house republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation .
among washington â€™ s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd , it â€™ s known as a â€œ cash flow tax with border adjustment .
this possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care , or even over individual income taxes .
the house republicans â€™ approach , instead of taxing the corporate income , goes after a firm â€™ s domestic cash flow : money that comes in from sales within the united states borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth .
â€œ but with cash flow you just follow the money .
and some of those potential losers are powerful .
â€œ but i don â€™ t want to wait that long .
republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars .
it â€™ s a deal that never should have been signed .
5 million per mile to build a fence , with an additional $ 4 .
2 million per mile for roads and more fencing , according to congressional officials .
those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly border with mexico .
â€œ i think that â€™ s a tough sell for them .

140,17445 , scientists say the clock of aging may be reversible - the new york times , new york times , nicholas wade,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0 , , '' at the salk institute in la jolla , calif. scientists are trying to get time to run backward .
biological time , that is .
embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth , which easily becomes uncontrolled .
â€œ what we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging , healthier organs , and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice , â€ dr. izpisua belmonte said .
this process lets the embryo â€™ s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body .
the epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties .
the epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups , known as marks , to its proteins .
only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging .
dr. izpisua belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited .
this gene activation is a natural function of the yamanaka factors .
and yet we do it all the same : we marry the wrong person .
nobody â€™ s perfect .
we visit their families .
we haven â€™ t .
and from such reasonable marriages , there flowed loneliness , infidelity , abuse , hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors .
we marry the wrong people because we don â€™ t associate being loved with feeling happy .
and that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle .
there can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness .
romanticism has been unhelpful to us it is a harsh philosophy .
we end up lonely and convinced that our union , with its imperfections , is not â€œ normal .

ms. bergquist , suffering from memory loss and insomnia , panicked every time she saw a tall man â€” the loose description of timothy â€™ s accomplice .
finally , wanting to avoid a trial , ms. bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which timothy would receive about 20 years .
timothy was impassive : â€œ i didn â€™ t care about life .
â€ â€œ i knew that timothy held the answers that i needed .
â€œ i needed to feel safe .
ms. bergquist also contacted holly chavez , the restorative justice coordinator at the kansas department of corrections , and asked whether a meeting would be possible .
timothy was also growing more introspective .
â€ the solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was .
â€œ you got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own .

â€ historically , whether it was the striving of â€œ the jeffersons â€ or â€œ the fresh prince of â€ or the settings of shows like â€œ sanford and son , â€ â€œ roc â€ or â€œ thea , â€ class differences have dominated black sitcoms in the era .
that these three recent shows are all created by ( kenya barris created â€œ â€ ) might enable them to attend differently to these nuances of lives .

but some 68 years later , google has been calling on dozens of artists , animators and illustrators with a update of mili â€™ s concept â€” a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it , at least for viewers wearing a vr headset .
in april 2015 , seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called tilt brush , google bought their company for an undisclosed sum â€” which is how mr. skillman and mr. hackett have come to be ensconced in the company â€™ s offices near the downtown waterfront here .
with google â€™ s support , tilt brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing , painting , even sculpting in space .
reviewers immediately dubbed it the vive â€™ s killer app .
tilt brush got its name because in its earliest versions , you would draw or paint on a surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space .
but put on a vive headset and step between the sensors yourself â€” as i did in a windowless room in google â€™ s new york offices â€” and the illusion of delusion disappears .
google â€™ s investment in virtual reality pales beside facebook â€™ s $ 2 billion purchase of the vr pioneer oculus .
â€œ that â€™ s just absurd .
jeff koons , whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $ 58 million , had early access , though he was not part of the artists in residence program .
bob mankoff , roz chast and other cartoonists for the new yorker have also checked it out , as has alex hirsch , the young animator behind disney â€™ s hit television series â€œ gravity falls .
in september 2015 , seven months before its release , he previewed its capabilities with â€œ step into the page , â€ a video .
â€œ the edges of the paper are no longer there , â€ he exclaimed in a as he did a loose , freehand sketch of ariel in virtual space .
â€œ this is not a flat drawing .
this is sculptural drawing .
â€œ i describe it as a sketchbook .
â€œ or it may just not work â€” but that â€™ s no reason not to try it .

other than that , mr. mankoff offered with a grin : â€œ the advice i would have for google is , more cats .

things were so sedate that mr. robertson did not even realize there had been a shooting .
â€œ it was like a herd reacting .
for the thousands who fled the terminals , seeking refuge on the tarmac or hiding wherever they could , food and water quickly became scarce .
bathrooms were nonexistent .
passengers on some planes that were either preparing to take off or trying to reach a gate were stuck on board for up to seven hours .
but it was the aftermath of the rumor , which was debunked relatively quickly , that left them bewildered and angry .
and it was real terror .
people were really , really , really terrified and crying .
it was a voluminous undertaking and we did it , as horrific and horrible as this scene was .
the authorities debunked the rumor about 30 to 45 minutes after it had started to spread , raising questions about whether the airport could have been reopened right away .
providing accurate information to passengers and airport and airline staff members also proved challenging .
instead , news , accurate and otherwise , traveled through word of mouth or was gleaned from cellphones .

â€œ his death disturbs the fragile balance we had in iran .
most are now in their 80s or even older .
but mr. khatami is all but paralyzed politically .
the judiciary has ordered all iranian media not to carry his picture or even quote his website .
he also referred obliquely to their disagreements .

also have faulted mr. rafsanjani for having founded a chain of affordable universities during the reconstruction that followed the war .
â€ ''
he was 82 .
his death was announced by iranian state television .
known as a pragmatist and centrist inclined toward economic liberalism and political authoritarianism , mr. rafsanjani was accused by critics of corruption in amassing his fortune and of a readiness for harsh tactics to deal with dissent at home and abroad .
in the closing stages of the war , which lasted from 1980 to 1988 , mr. rafsanjani was appointed acting commander in chief of iranian forces and was widely credited with persuading the leadership in tehran to accept a united nations resolution that ended the fighting .
mr. rafsanjani â€™ s clout declined sharply during the presidency of mahmoud ahmadinejad , from 2005 to 2013 .
however , if this is intentional , then this is treachery .
ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani was born on aug. 23 , 1934 , in the village of bahraman near the town of rafsanjan in iran â€™ s southeastern kerman province .
at 14 , he left his home village to study theology in the muslim holy city of qum , iran , where he became a disciple of ayatollah khomeini .
by some accounts , at the time of his death , mr. rafsanjani was the last surviving member of an inner circle of islamic revolutionaries active during ayatollah khomeini â€™ s exile from 1964 to 1979 , fighting an often bloody contest with the notorious savak secret police loyal to shah mohammed reza pahlavi .
information on survivors was not immediately available .
while his economic liberalism and privatization policies were popular among iran â€™ s entrepreneurial classes , many poor iranians perceived no improvement in their plight .
moreover , critics asserted that the rafsanjani presidency coincided with the spread of corruption and the infiltration by the islamic revolutionary guards corps of important economic enterprises .
the family â€™ s business interests also included real estate , construction and oil deals .
in 2003 , forbes magazine said mr. rafsanjani â€™ s personal wealth exceeded $ 1 billion .
in may 2013 , mr. rafsanjani announced plans for a comeback , entering his name for presidential elections that june , calculating that , after the years of decline under mr. ahmadinejad , iranians would think that mr. rafsanjani â€™ s reputation as a pragmatist and modernizer would offset some of the opprobrium attached to his staggering wealth .
at the time , he argued that iran was in an economic â€œ danger zone â€ because of mr. ahmadinejad â€™ s â€œ amateurism .
â€ but he was disqualified by the guardian council , an electoral vetting body controlled by .
in another controversy , in may 2016 , mr. rafsanjani was drawn into a ferocious debate over a meeting between his activist daughter , faezeh , and fariba kamalabadi , a leader of the baha â€™ is , a minority religious group regarded by the clerical hierarchy as impure pagans .

arrests volkswagen executive on conspiracy charge in emissions scandal - the new york times , new york times , '' adam goldman , hiroko tabuchi and jack ewing '' ,2017-01-09,2017.0,1.0 , , '' the f. b. i. has arrested a volkswagen executive in florida , accusing him of playing a central role in a broad conspiracy to keep united states regulators from discovering that diesel vehicles made by the company were programmed to cheat on emissions tests .
the executive , oliver schmidt , a german who is the former top emissions compliance manager for volkswagen in the united states , was arrested on saturday by investigators in florida on a charge of conspiracy to defraud the united states .
the arrest of mr. schmidt is an escalation of the criminal investigation into emissions cheating by volkswagen and comes amid talks between the company and the united states justice department about what penalties the carmaker should accept as part of a settlement .
mr. schmidt continued to represent volkswagen after the company admitted in september that cars were programmed to dupe regulators .
he appeared before a committee of the british parliament in january , telling legislators that volkswagen â€™ s behavior was not illegal in europe .
lawyers representing mr. schmidt did not respond to requests for comment late sunday .
officials at the justice department also declined to comment , as did an f. b. i. spokesman in detroit .
â€ a volkswagen spokesman in germany also declined to comment .
in september 2015 , mr. schmidt and other volkswagen officials formally acknowledged the existence of a defeat device that allowed volkswagen cars to cheat emissions tests .
it has already agreed to pay $ 16 billion to owners of diesel vehicles and will probably have to pay several billion dollars more in fines .
volkswagen eventually said that it had fitted 11 million diesel cars worldwide with illegal software that made the vehicles capable of defeating pollution tests .
but those controls were not fully deployed on the road , where cars spewed nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times the levels allowed under the clean air act .
james liang , a former volkswagen engineer who worked for the company in california , pleaded guilty in september to charges that included conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating the clean air act .
the arrest came as volkswagen and the justice department neared a deal to pay more than $ 2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating .
the german automaker has been eager to put the justice department investigation behind it before donald j. trump is sworn in on jan. 20 .
american prosecutors had traveled to germany in recent months to interview volkswagen executives , according to german prosecutors .
the criminal case against volkswagen , and the potential guilty plea , set it apart from other recent auto industry investigations .
prosecutors are also mulling criminal charges against takata , the japanese manufacturer under criminal investigation for its defective airbags .
volkswagen has already agreed to pay up to nearly $ 16 billion to resolve civil claims in what has become one of the largest consumer settlements ever in the united states , involving half a million cars .
under the settlement , most car owners have the option of either selling their vehicles back to volkswagen or getting them fixed , provided the automaker could propose a fix that satisfied regulators .
the scandal has affected many volkswagen and audi models , including the audi a3 and volkswagen beetle , golf , jetta and passat diesel cars . ''
the police called the episode an act of terrorism .
hamas , the islamic militant group that holds sway in gaza , praised sunday â€™ s attack , without taking responsibility for it .

â€œ there is nothing heroic in such actions .

at a news conference , intel , the chip maker , provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits .
intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone , in case anybody felt inclined to vomit , an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people .
the excitement around virtual reality took a huge leap in march 2014 when facebook announced it planned to acquire oculus for $ 2 billion and the social network â€™ s chief executive , mark zuckerberg , suggested that virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology after mobile .
48 billion was invested in in that category , compared with $ 331 million the prior year , estimated pitchbook , a financial data firm .
mr. rosenfeld announced at the end of november that he was shutting the company down .
superdata research , a technology research firm , estimated that oculus had sold 360 , 000 headsets and htc 450 , 000 since their products went on sale in march and june , respectively .
both of those headsets require pcs with powerful processors .
the firm estimated that sony , which began selling a virtual reality headset in october , has sold about 750 , 000 .
sony â€™ s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a playstation 4 console , more than 53 million of which have already been sold .
a bundle with the playstation vr headset and specialized controllers sells for $ 500 , while comparable bundles from htc and oculus sell for just under $ 800 each .
less expensive sony and oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality .
â€ in a bright spot , samsung said last week at ces that is had shipped more than five million of its gear vr headsets , which act as a cradle for a mobile phone , with lenses that create a image from the phone â€™ s screen .
samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a samsung smartphone .
ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome .

â€œ the no .
the video shows mr. ross driving around town in his ford truck , puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community , which is in the miami area .
the firm has heavy traction among mr. ross â€™ s primary audience â€” young men â€” on the entertainment sites that it owns , like uproxx , dime and brobible .
woven has also specialized in productions that , on the surface , do not feel like ads .
spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies .
the series , sponsored by coors banquet beer and run across uproxx , was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising .
according to brad feinberg , senior director of media and digital marketing for millercoors , it was a success , receiving more than 33 million views .

what were the longshoremen â€™ s grievances ?
they hung around the food trucks and milled about the parking lots , unsure why they had stopped working and unsure what it would take for work to resume .
â€ in that movie , the longshoremen were reluctant , even frightened , to talk to the authorities , whether a priest or a detective , because the mob controlled the waterfront .
it was , according to federal agents in a 2010 affidavit , the tribute that a group of newark longshoremen paid the genovese crime family each christmas .
â€œ i call it the broadway of broken dreams .
â€ perhaps the starkest difference at the port today is in how many machines there are , and how few people .
mr. daggett declined , through the longshoremen â€™ s association â€™ s spokesman , to be interviewed .
and , most cruelly , the mob controlled which of the longshoreman would be selected to work .
all this began to change with containerization , as goods were no longer shipped loose but packed into containers that stacked efficiently , and transferred easily between ships and trucks and trains .
the waterfront today has largely receded from the city â€™ s consciousness and even its geography .
and to some extent , so has the mob .
the gigantes , for instance , have 10 relatives â€” mostly nephews , and grandsons â€” working on the waterfront , according to the commission .
the union has complained about such aggressive tactics , and the longstanding antipathy between the longshoremen â€™ s association and the waterfront commission may have been the driving force behind the strike last year .
â€ he added , â€œ you just don â€™ t hear about that at all anymore .
at a public hearing before the waterfront commission in 2010 , he protested investigators â€™ insinuation that the ports were under mob control .
he was so wary of being tarred as a mobster that he even chose what to wear with care .
he had been told he would be taken out â€œ in a box , â€ according to a lawsuit he filed .
mr. arsenault checked off the various forms of thievery and extortion , both big and small , that he learned of through his investigations .
truckers , in order to be allowed to retrieve their container and leave the port , have been encouraged to buy overpriced bottles of water , or even girl scout cookies from the longshoremen , he said .
they also tend to be rather opaque .

american officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time a senior national security official cited security , counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns .
national security concerns have also complicated anbang â€™ s efforts to acquire other properties in the united states .
one deal , to buy the hotel del coronado in san diego , fell apart in october amid concerns from the committee on foreign investment in the united states , which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or companies .

health insurance and health care for millions of americans are at risk .
five republican senators proposed on monday to extend the deadline for drafting repeal legislation by five weeks , until march 3 .
hospitals were expecting to receive tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue for treating people who were newly insured under the health law , and they are alarmed at the prospect that it may now be repealed .
but , they say , if congress goes ahead and rolls back the expansion of coverage , it must also restore tens of billions of dollars that the health law cut from medicare payments to hospitals .
a coalition of consumers and liberal advocacy groups is spending more than $ 2 million on television advertisements urging congress to stop its attack on the law .
the ads , by the alliance for healthcare security , are aimed at a handful of republican senators , including lisa murkowski of alaska , jeff flake and john mccain of arizona , susan collins of maine , dean heller of nevada , lamar alexander and mr. corker of tennessee , and shelley moore capito of west virginia .

ms. willis , a wedding minister from south carolina , had looked forward to taking her daughters to the march .
â€œ i was born scared .
but long before the first buses roll to washington and sister demonstrations take place in other cities , contentious conversations about race have erupted nearly every day among marchers , exhilarating some and alienating others .
and at a time when a presidential candidate ran against political correctness and won â€” with half of white female voters supporting him â€” is this the time to tone down talk about race or to double down ?
many older white women spent their lives fighting for rights like workplace protections that younger women now take for granted .
black women who have worked their whole lives as maids might care more about the minimum wage or police brutality than about seeing a woman in the white house .
the organizers of the 1913 suffrage march on washington asked black women to march at the back of the parade .
the issue of race has followed the march from its inception .
then a friend called to tell ms .

bland recalled .
ms .
bland felt strongly that it was the right thing to do .
bland .
â€œ which is what movements and marches are for .
â€ but the tone of the discussion , particularly online , can become so raw that some marchers feel they are no longer welcome .

listening to our speeches .
you should be drowning yourselves in our poetry .
that phrase â€” check your privilege â€” exasperates ms. willis .
in announcing his intention to nominate ms. devos , mr. trump described her as â€œ a brilliant and passionate education advocate .
both organizations have also received money from the koch family .
indeed , the devoses â€™ education activism , which favors alternatives to traditional public schools , appears to derive from the same views that inform their suspicion of government .
and perhaps more than other billionaires , the devoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending .
in the 2016 cycle alone , according to the michigan campaign finance network , the family spent roughly $ 14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates , parties , pacs and super pacs .
the family had a more winning public face in dick devos , who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir , spending over $ 30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of michigan in 2006 .
â€œ they were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word â€˜ yes. â€™ they turned into spoiled little brats when they were told â€˜ no .
their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder mr. devos â€™ s .
according to federal disclosures , amway , which dick devos ran between 1993 and 2002 , has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax .
â€ it is not unusual for the wealthy â€” who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education , according to the group â€” to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms .
we don â€™ t need to have all this window dressing .
â€™ â€ mr. pumford recalled .
the devoses will walk away from us .
â€™ â€ mr. pumford added : â€œ she told me that was going to happen .
but the devoses â€™ lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation .
â€ the chief culprits , according to mr. pagel and others at the state capitol when the bill passed , were lobbyists closely tied to the devoses .
ms. devos â€™ s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers .
â€ he added , â€œ devos doesn â€™ t need the job now , nor will she be looking for an education job later .
â€ but critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda .

196,17506 , here â€™ s how clemson won the college football playoff championship - the new york times , new york times , victor mather,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0 , , '' clemson upset alabama and won the college football national championship , in tampa early tuesday morning .
this game is not just for me , it â€™ s for all the alumni , the fans , my family in gainesville .
watson â€™ s achilles â€™ heel during the regular season was the interception , but he threw none in this game .
its freshman quarterback jalen hurts was for only 131 yards .
more watson passing pulled clemson to within on a touchdown to renfrow .
another long clemson drive concluded with a pass from watson to williams , and clemson was back within 3 , .
alabama answered like champions with a quick drive .
hurts completed just 2 of 8 passes , for 10 yards .
the tigers were also hurt by an uninspired failed plunge on at the alabama 41 .
the clemson highlight was probably a partially blocked punt that took an alabama roll anyway .
alabama was breaking runs and its defense was swamping clemson â€™ s star quarterback deshaun watson .
alabama did it on the ground , rushing for 143 yards .
the freshman quarterback jalen hurts was for only 40 yards .
watson woke up with a drive through the previously impenetrable alabama defense with six minutes left .
he capped it by taking the ball into the end zone himself .
the game was dominated by the defenses , which frustrated most of the game â€™ s drives on both sides .
watson avoided throwing an interception , which he was often guilty of during the season .
a poor alabama punt gave clemson the ball at alabama â€™ s 42 and deshaun watson took advantage with a quick drive culminating in a touchdown to hunter renfrow .
watson was up to 228 yards passing .
he was for only 49 yards .
then o. j. howard badly beat clemson â€™ s van smith , and raced down the sidelines for a touchdown .
we all know how that ended . ''
but this time , the usually unifying ritual was marred by discord .
israelis called it the â€œ azaria effect , â€ referring to sgt .
elor azaria , the soldier who was convicted last week of manslaughter for shooting a wounded and incapacitated palestinian assailant in the head .
video from the scene of sunday â€™ s attack showed dozens of armed soldiers fleeing from the truck instead of trying to shoot the driver .
some israelis who had complained that the army â€™ s high command failed to back up sergeant azaria asserted that the soldiers had fallen short because they were afraid of being put on trial .
the military , security experts and soldiers at the scene quickly rejected that notion .
in this small , country where most jewish are drafted into years of service , the military has long been a rare reserve of respect and consensus .
on a routine educational tour of jerusalem , they were caught as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of old city .
â€œ it has nothing to do with elor azaria , â€ she added .
â€œ it â€™ s unrelated .
there were also concerns , according to officers in the field , that too many people shooting could cause a â€œ friendly fire â€ accident .
â€œ we send them to the army we know they might not return .
â€ the azaria case , regarding a shooting in the west bank city of hebron last march that was caught on video , unleashed its own kind of friendly fire and fury .
the backlash was not long in coming , and was equally charged .

198,17508 , volkswagen executive â€™ s trip to u.s .
to pounce - the new york times , new york times , '' jack ewing , adam goldman and hiroko tabuchi '' ,2017-01-10,2017.0,1.0 , , '' when f. b. i. agents learned that a prime suspect in the volkswagen emissions scandal was traveling to the united states , investigators knew they were on the cusp of a rare feat : the arrest of an overseas corporate executive accused of wrongdoing .
the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case .
mr. schmidt , formerly volkswagen â€™ s top emissions compliance executive in the united states , has been charged with defrauding the government and violating the clean air act .
he will be moved to detroit , where he was originally charged and where court documents suggest that he might be valuable in the government â€™ s investigation into other volkswagen officials .
mr. schmidt , 48 , played a central role in volkswagen â€™ s of its diesel emissions cheating , according to an affidavit from an f. b. i. agent that was unsealed on monday .
mr. schmidt briefed executives in detail months earlier , in july , according to the criminal complaint , filed in federal court in michigan .
the timeline of the briefing has not been laid out before by prosecutors .
it is unclear which employees â€” above or below mr. schmidt â€” the government believes were involved .
mr. schmidt reported to officials at volkswagen headquarters in wolfsburg .
volkswagen is nearing a deal with the justice department to pay more than $ 2 billion to resolve the criminal investigation into the emissions cheating , according to three people briefed on the negotiations .
that deal , though , would not prevent charges against individual employees .
volkswagen â€™ s emissions scandal has cost the company $ 16 billion in civil settlements in the united states alone .
the fallout from the scandal has already reached volkswagen â€™ s executive ranks .
german prosecutors are now investigating mr. winterkorn and another executive , hans dieter pÃ¶tsch , about whether they violated securities laws .
for united states investigators , the arrest of mr. schmidt is a stroke of luck .
volkswagen declined to comment .
why mr. schmidt risked arrest by traveling in the united states remains a mystery .
mr. schmidt was among the first to react in early 2014 when a study by west virginia university found evidence that volkswagen diesel cars polluted far more under normal driving conditions than they did in official testing labs .
in an email to a colleague in april 2014 , he wrote , â€œ it should first be decided whether we are honest , â€ according to an affidavit signed by ian dinsmore , an f. b. i. special agent .
the affidavit was the basis for a criminal complaint against mr. schmidt .
volkswagen decided to mask its emissions cheating from regulators , according to the complaint and lawsuits filed by the new york attorney general â€™ s office .
to buy time , the company recalled volkswagens in the united states for an update of the engine software in early 2015 , even though mr. schmidt and others knew that change would not bring the cars into compliance , according to the complaint .
in july , he briefed executives on the risks that volkswagen faced .
according to the complaint , mr. schmidt and other volkswagen employees briefed top managers in wolfsburg ahead of a meeting with officials at the california regulatory agency , also known as carb , which took the lead in the investigation .
mr. schmidt explained that the cars contained software that recognized when a vehicle was undergoing tests .
the defeat device increased pollution controls so the cars would pass muster .
the executives decided not to disclose the defeat device , according to the complaint .
the account runs counter to the timeline volkswagen has detailed .
the continued into august , according to the complaint .
having run out of excuses for the emissions discrepancies , mr. schmidt and other volkswagen managers met with carb and e. p. a. officials in september and admitted the presence of a defeat device .
in january , he testified before the british parliament as part of an inquiry into the emissions testing .
mr. schmidt told the members of parliament that volkswagen had removed software that recognized when an emissions test was underway .

( the contractor that employed snowden had been acquired by a private equity firm that was pressuring it to cut costs , and elaborate background checks are expensive . )
this may be a role whose run is coming to an end .

the heart of the matter is the second of these concerns , not the first .
in the snowden affair , the press didn â€™ t decide what stayed secret , and neither did congress , the white house or the n. s. a. snowden did . ''

â€ after decades of debate , a confederate battle flag was removed from the grounds of south carolina â€™ s state capitol with remarkable swiftness , lowered for good less than a month after the shooting , following an emotional debate in the legislature .

217,17530 , the art of flavor at flora bar in the met breuer - the new york times , new york times , pete wells,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0 , , '' i â€™ m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why ignacio mattos â€™ s food is so good .
â€ at estela , the place on houston street that put him on the map , i described his food as â€œ almost familiar , but not quite .
â€ ( what i ate was unpretty and highly delicious . )
after spending some time at flora bar , which mr. mattos opened in october , i â€™ ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can â€™ t see .
it â€™ s a kind of cooking that â€™ s almost invisible .
flora bar is inside the met breuer museum , marcel breuer â€™ s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on madison avenue in the 70s , regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style .
â€ the food at flora bar is much easier to like than warm beer .
a simple red disc on a white plate , flora bar â€™ s tuna tartare isn â€™ t like any i â€™ ve had before it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots , neither of which hides the clean , cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna .
the bÃ©arnaise is silky and light on the herbs .
well , there â€™ s the price , $ 29 , which may be a record .
but then there â€™ s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves , glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles .
they â€™ re terrific , and so is their dark , uncloying cocktail sauce .
flora bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in kerry james marshall â€™ s show upstairs and now want a cheap , filling meal .
the wine list at flora bar is about as exhaustive as any artist â€™ s career retrospective .
it contains multitudes , and in three visits , i barely scratched the surface .
2 cocktail .
the service can be punctilious in a way that i imagine is meant to appeal to the upper east sider , but fans of estela ( and there are many upper east siders in that group ) may find it slightly .
on the tapas side , we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette , pink shavings of jamÃ³n ibÃ©rico , and a plate of anchovies , three cured in oil and three in brine .
i couldn â€™ t .
representing sashimi , there is shimmering raw seafood , some of it on or under squares of nori .
you â€™ re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla .
a month ago , the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste , and i was quietly happy .
when i went back , the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin , and i went completely giddy .
it took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish , the lobster crudo .
raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with .
it â€™ s refined and almost comforting .
stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias .
halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts , although they were very good parts .
natasha pickowicz â€™ s desserts sound safe but can be daring .
after the initial shock , i loved it .
the assault in the afghan capital was the deadliest of several attacks on tuesday , including an explosion at a government guesthouse in the southern province of kandahar that wounded the provincial governor and the visiting ambassador of the united arab emirates .
he spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters .
the deteriorating situation in the south , in particular , prompted the dispatch of about 200 nato military advisers to farah province .
it amounts to a desperate attempt to break some of the taliban â€™ s momentum â€” the insurgents largely control six districts of the province , the government controls two , and another six are contested , according to bashir ahmad shakir , the head of the security committee at the helmand provincial council .

much of the composition of the microbiome is established early in life , shaped by forces like your genetics and whether you were or .
but a new study in mice and people adds to evidence that suggests you can take steps to enrich your gut microbiota .
altering your microbiome , however , may not be easy , and nobody knows how long it might take .
so if the microbial community in your gut has been shaped by a daily diet of cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizza , for example , it won â€™ t respond as quickly to a healthy diet as a gut shaped by vegetables and fruits that has more varied microbiota to begin with .
some of their favorite foods were processed cheese , pepperoni and lunch meats .
another aspect of the study suggests the company you keep may also enrich your gut microbiota â€” at least in mice .

â€œ all that â€™ s been fine , really .
â€œ to me , it â€™ s just too bad his time will be over .
and so early saturday , in temperatures barely above zero , thousands waited outside for the chance to receive free tickets to witness the end of that story .
would chicago â€™ s spin in the spotlight , complicated as it had been at times , be over now , too ?
not long ago , a crew of bicyclists peered at the chair from the foyer of the small shop , where a line of men forms on saturdays and â€œ the obama cut , â€ a taper on the side and the back for $ 24 , remains popular .
â€ tour buses , once an oddity , cruise down hyde park boulevard with some frequency now .
people can occasionally be seen pulling over with cameras outside a nondescript shopping center along 53rd street , where an plaque notes the obamas â€™ first date , during which barack obama bought michelle robinson ice cream from a shop that has since become a subway .
both valerie jarrett and david axelrod , who is now back in hyde park at the institute of politics at the university of chicago , were senior advisers .
austan goolsbee , another hyde parker , was an economic adviser , and desirÃ©e rogers was an early white house social secretary .
and mr. obama â€™ s chiefs of staff included william m. daley , the brother of chicago â€™ s former mayor , and rahm emanuel , who was later elected mayor .
but it is not just the shutting of that pipeline that causes concern .
some complained that mr. obama had not interceded forcefully enough .
â€œ this is like your kids , â€ she added .
â€œ he â€™ s done his thing .
â€ ''
but he warned , in the wake of a toxic presidential election , that economic inequity , racism and threatened to shred the nation â€™ s democratic fabric .
in charleston , s. c. dylann s. roof , the white supremacist who shot nine black churchgoers , was sentenced to death .
he recalled the 2008 campaign that started him on his improbable journey to the white house .
he thanked the army of volunteers and staff members who swept him into the oval office , ending with the iconic chant , â€œ yes , we can .
â€ and reflecting on all they had accomplished , he added , â€œ yes , we did .
â€ as the crowd of 18 , 000 clapped and stamped their feet , mr. obama dabbed his eyes .
lamenting the perennially low voter turnout rates , mr. obama urged people to become involved .
â€œ but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured .
those hours had a purpose .
â€œ better than waiting to shop on black friday .
honestly , i don â€™ t want him to leave , but i â€™ m sure it will be a load off his shoulders .
â€œ any time right is done , it will sooner or later stand up again .

mr. kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets , his lawyer said .
some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the united states government .
mr. kushner â€™ s plan is to sell assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother , said ms. gorelick , who added that she had been consulting with federal ethics officials in an attempt to minimize opposition to mr. kushner â€™ s appointment .
under the arrangement , mr. kushner will divest his holdings in his family real estate firm â€™ s flagship property at 666 fifth avenue sell his stake in the new york observer newspaper divest his interest in his brother â€™ s firm , thrive capital and restructure other investments .
the scion of a prominent democratic family active in new jersey politics , mr. kushner showed few early signs that he would become a national political power player .
a harvard graduate , he is a lifelong democrat , liberal on social issues .
like his ideologically limber he has donated to democratic candidates .
by his own account , he underwent something of a personal political transformation during the campaign , embracing mr. trump â€™ s fiery and conservative economic message after spending months crisscrossing red and america .
mr. kushner will divest of his holdings in the observer and has stepped down as its publisher his the newspaper â€™ s chairman , will assume that role .
â€ ''
but because he plans to sell to his brother or to a family trust controlled by his mother , some ethics lawyers interviewed questioned how meaningful the divestiture would be .
not only does mr. kushner intend to sell the assets to his brother , joshua , a venture capitalist , and to a trust controlled by his mother , seryl , but his mother and siblings are the beneficiaries of the trust .
recent maneuvers over the tower at 666 fifth avenue underscore the complications .
while the family trust will take over mr. kushner â€™ s stake in the building , the value of his interest and other details of the transaction are not known .
mr. painter noted that the trust was irrevocable , meaning it can not be modified without the permission of the beneficiaries .
he also said it was a positive sign that mr. kushner â€™ s wife and young children were not beneficiaries .
however , other relatives are .
226,17540 , '' as protests flare , iran bids farewell to rafsanjani - the new york times '' , new york times , thomas erdbrink,2017-01-11,2017.0,1.0 , , '' tehran â€” iranians bade farewell to ayatollah akbar hashemi rafsanjani on tuesday , with the sprawling state funeral veering slightly off script when groups of mourners started shouting opposition slogans .
the authorities were forced to raise the volume on the loudspeakers playing lamentation songs after some in the crowds took up cries of â€œ oh , hussein , mir hussein , â€ a reference to a former presidential candidate , mir hussein moussavi , who has been under house arrest since 2011 .
video clips on social media showed mourners shouting â€œ death to russia â€ and â€œ the russian embassy is the den of espionage , â€ as they passed the embassy â€™ s complex in the heart of tehran .
people also called for the release of hunger strikers in iranian prisons .
people showed up early , some wearing scarves around their faces to protect them from the morning cold .
families passed by , pushing strollers carrying babies wearing woolen hats .
students took videos with their cellphones .
5 million by official estimates â€” that many of the dignitaries and family members invited to the campus were marooned in their cars amid the crowds .
some hid behind curtains others waved at the collection of camera phones .
such deviations from the official line were put aside by the authorities on tuesday .
potential troublemakers were not invited .
the same apparatus that normally churns out posters showing uncle sam with blood dripping from his teeth to burn during demonstrations , now printed pictures of mr. rafsanjani , extolling him as â€œ a man of history , who is immortal .
some wore green wristbands , the color of the opposition , and flashed victory signs .
â€ it was hard , she and her friends agreed , to come up with the name of anybody within iran â€™ s establishment to replace mr. rafsanjani .
she knew then that germany was poised for a major military incursion .
often under fire , occasionally arrested and possessed of such a keen nose for covert information that from time to time she was accused of being a spy â€” both by local governments and by the british â€” ms. hollingworth was friend , or foe , to seemingly everyone in a position of power in the world at midcentury .
she obtained the first interview with mohammed reza pahlavi after he became the shah of iran in 1941 , and what was very likely among the last , after he was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 1979 .
embedded long before the term was applied to journalists , she slept in trucks and in trenches , at times buried up to her neck in sand for warmth on cold desert nights .
she once held off an armed algerian policeman by threatening to hit him about the head with a shoe .
â€œ i must admit that i enjoy being in a war , â€ she told the telegraph in 2011 , on the eve of her 100th birthday .
clare hollingworth was born on oct. 10 , 1911 , in knighton in central england , outside leicester .
â€ ) partly in deference to her upbringing , she became engaged â€œ to a suitable young man , â€ though she soon broke off the engagement and further scandalized her parents by announcing her intention to become a journalist .
â€ in the 1930s , ms. hollingworth attended the school of slavonic and east european studies in london and afterward studied at the university of zagreb , then in yugoslavia .
there , in early 1939 , she aided thousands of refugees from the sudetenland â€” the region of czechoslovakia that had been annexed by the nazis in october 1938 â€” arranging travel documents that would let them cross into poland .
she wrote about their plight for small publications in britain .
awakened by explosions at dawn on sept. 1 , ms. hollingworth , from her quarters in katowice , saw german bombers overhead and the flash of artillery fire in the distance .
she telephoned a friend at the british embassy in warsaw .
â€œ the war has begun ! â€ she cried .
she held the receiver out the window as german tanks roared outside .
in vietnam , a sniper â€™ s bullet narrowly missed her head .
her second husband , geoffrey hoare , a journalist whom she married in the early 1950s , died in 1965 .
her death was confirmed by patrick garrett , her grandnephew and her biographer .
over time , some members of the british press grew alienated by what they saw as ms. hollingworth â€™ s imperious manner .
â€œ ms .
her other books include â€œ the three weeks â€™ war in poland â€ ( 1940 ) â€œ there â€™ s a german just behind me â€ ( 1942 ) â€œ the arabs and the west â€ ( 1952 ) and â€œ mao and the men against him â€ ( 1985 ) .
and the issue has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on a lucrative but often overlooked niche within the largely publishing world .
for publishers , the books have been reliable cash cows .
bill o â€™ reilly â€™ s historical â€œ killing â€ series has more than 17 million copies in print .
in the weeks leading up to the election , the lists were dominated by partisan polemics by dinesh d â€™ souza , michael savage , edward klein and gary j. byrne , whose book â€œ crisis of character â€ sold some 247 , 000 hardcover copies , according to nielsen .
publishers are proceeding cautiously .
others are returning to safer topics , like ronald reagan or the founding fathers .
â€œ the audience has fractured .
would trump voters buy a paul ryan book today ?
i don â€™ t know .
â€ authors are also losing a reliable driver of book sales â€” the clintons .
last year , regnery alone had three books that took aim at mrs. clinton , including its first graphic novel , â€œ clinton cash , â€ adapted from the book by peter schweizer , and â€œ hillary â€™ s america , â€ mr. d â€™ souza â€™ s book , which sold more than 200 , 000 copies .

seven bees were previously listed as endangered , but they are found only in hawaii .
65 million acres of federal land and denied six permits for oil exploration in the atlantic , partly because the seismic testing harms marine animals .
a study last year from a group associated with the united nations warned that an increasing number of species that aid the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars â€™ worth of food each year face extinction .
â€œ when you â€™ re talking about saving the bumblebees , what you â€™ re really talking about is saving the community .
they also use the technique of â€œ buzz pollination , â€ in which they grab the part of the flower in their jaws and vibrate their wings , shaking the pollen loose , a process that seems to benefit plants like tomatoes , peppers and cranberries , according to the fish and wildlife service .
bumblebees are particularly important to agriculture , but agriculture is often unkind to them .
climate change may also be shrinking the bees â€™ habitat , because of drought , rising temperatures , more storms and mismatches in timing : plants may start to flower at times when the bees are not ready to pollinate .
it also presents serious threats to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies and other pollinators , such as honeybees .
while these species may not be as visible or as charismatic as polar bears or other mammals whose existences are threatened by a changing climate , placing them on the endangered list is a victory for the species and those who fight for it .

i was headed to the juilliard school .
the feeling was exhilarating .
i stood there witnessing thousands of people walk by my face , glance at my face .
my heart was so happy i almost forgot why i was even in herald square to begin with .
when i was a kid , the famous apollo theater had come to my hometown to audition kids for â€œ showtime at the apollo .

and at the bottom of the billboard were the words â€œ see danielle shine .

if all the information in the dossier is false , it is a very sophisticated fabrication .
but as of jan. 20 , mr. trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies , and he may not approve such an investigation .
because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on mr. trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor the times has been able to verify , times editors decided to briefly summarize the claims and not publish the document .
that is a question the director , james b. comey , may eventually have to answer .

but the investigation surfaced again at a senate hearing on tuesday in a series of questions from senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon , to the f. b. i. director , james b. comey .
but agents have struggled to confirm it , according to federal officials familiar with the investigation .
democrats on tuesday night pressed for a thorough investigation of the claims in the memos .

7 million civilian employees in the white house and more than 130 executive branch agencies .

in that time , dr. shulkin has nearly doubled the amount of health care that veterans receive through private doctors .
but he has also rejected calls for broader privatization , saying that it would cost untold billions and undermine the hospital system â€” a stance that puts him at odds with mr. trump .

volkswagen also formally pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the clean air act , customs violations and obstruction of justice .
3 billion in criminal and civil penalties in connection with the federal investigation , bringing the total cost of the deception to volkswagen in the united states , including settlements of suits by car owners , to $ 20 billion â€” one of the costliest corporate scandals in history .
â€œ when regulators expressed concerns , volkswagen obfuscated , â€ she said .
â€œ and they ultimately lied .
â€ extracting a guilty plea from a major corporation is a notable feat for an administration that has been accused of allowing companies to buy themselves out of indictments through deferred prosecution deals .
it is unclear whether the five executives named on wednesday will ever appear in a united states court .
if they are in germany , the country does not normally extradite its citizens .
even if germany does not extradite or prosecute them , the charges in the united states would severely limit their ability to travel .
â€ regulators in the united states first began to investigate volkswagen early in 2014 after a study by west virginia university showed that its diesel cars polluted far more on the road than during official emissions tests .
mr. schmidt was arrested on saturday at miami international airport as he was about to board a flight to germany .
in september , a former volkswagen engineer who worked for the company in california , james liang , pleaded guilty to charges that included conspiracy to defraud the federal government and violating the clean air act .
others have been accused of concocting excuses for the excess emissions and trying to prevent regulators from discovering the truth .
volkswagen also admitted that its employees destroyed emails and other evidence in 2015 as it became clear that regulators would soon learn of the illegal software .
volkswagen must also cooperate with investigations into current and former employees .
â€œ volkswagen deeply regrets the behavior that gave rise to the diesel crisis .
â€œ the agreements that we have reached with the u. s. government reflect our determination to address misconduct that went against all of the values volkswagen holds so dear .
they are an important step forward for our company and all our employees .

mr. obama has also appeared to concede in recent weeks that he spent a limited amount of time tending to the democratic party as an institution during his time in office , and in a television interview explained almost apologetically that the presidency is a job .
â€œ that â€™ s because of the congress that he had to deal with , which was a function of the 2010 redistricting effort .
right now , there are 25 states in which republicans control the whole government â€” the governorship and the legislature â€” versus just six wholly controlled by democrats .
yet in a sign of tensions that might later emerge , mr. holder suggested that some democratic incumbents might have to be willing to run in more competitive districts , to avoid clustering core democratic constituencies in a tiny number of districts .
and mr. holder said bluntly that black lawmakers could also win seats that are not necessarily .

254,17570 , taiwan responds after china sends carrier to taiwan strait - the new york times , new york times , michael forsythe and chris buckley,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0 , , '' hong kong â€” taiwan scrambled fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the taiwan strait on wednesday after china sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway , taiwan â€™ s official central news agency reported .
â€ china sent the carrier , which had been conducting exercises in the south china sea , into the taiwan strait on wednesday morning .
mark c. toner , a state department spokesman , told reporters in washington in response to a question about the liaoning â€™ s passage through the strait that the united states â€œ wouldn â€™ t have a problem â€ with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law .
it also was not the first time the liaoning had sailed through the strait : it passed through in november 2013 on its way to the south china sea after having been commissioned only the year before .
in past decades , the united states has shown its resolve to defend taiwan by sailing carriers through the taiwan strait .
in 1995 , the aircraft carrier nimitz transited the strait amid heightened tensions after beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters .
last month , a chinese warship seized an underwater drone belonging to the united states navy about 50 miles northwest of subic bay in the philippines .

mr. xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point .
mr. xi has carried on that theme with much more aggressive actions , including overseeing construction of military infrastructure in the south china sea â€™ s contested waters and establishing a regional lending bank opposed by the united states .
behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the u. s. is in disarray , europe is feckless , and so on .
strong sentiments erupted last year in the movement in britain that culminated in the popular vote by british citizens to leave the european union .
the bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from china , including the transfer of money to hong kong by wealthy chinese .
â€œ yet , in the past year , we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland china decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi .

the bottlenecks have overwhelmed many of the camps , especially on the greek islands , where migrants arriving after the march deal are supposed to be held until being deported to turkey .
the camp at moria , for instance , run by the greek police and nongovernmental organizations and designed for about 3 , 000 people , was reinforced with small container shelters that can each house up to 30 people .

the de facto leader , jay y. lee , the vice chairman of samsung , will be questioned on thursday , according to the special prosecutor â€™ s office , which recommended that he also be investigated on suspicion of perjury .
investigators at the special prosecutor â€™ s office have questioned other senior samsung executives as suspects about the bribery accusations .
neither samsung nor mr. lee responded immediately to the announcement on wednesday .
the reference on wednesday to possible perjury charges against mr. lee stemmed from that testimony .
the special prosecutor , which took over the investigations from the state prosecutors last month , has been looking into possible bribery charges against not only ms. park but the businesses , particularly samsung .
ms. park can not be indicted while in office .
samsung gave the largest donations to ms. choi â€™ s foundations , totaling $ 17 million .
samsung also contributed $ 1 .
3 million to a winter sports program for young athletes that ms. choi and her nephew ran .

â€ for years , iran has been under a series of international sanctions prohibiting it from exporting arms .
in 2013 , the navy stopped another dhow off the yemeni coast and found it to be carrying antiaircraft missiles and launchers , rifle and cartridges , c4 plastic explosives , equipment and other military items .
he added that the evidence of iran â€™ s hand in the shipments , while strong , was not ironclad .
the consultancy also did not suggest that the evidence indicated a direct handoff of weapons from the dhows to houthi forces .
rather , it said , the weapons appear to be offloaded in somalia and transferred to smaller vessels for smuggling into southern yemen .
weapons from iranian dhows would not be alone in reaching the conflict , which has been fueled in part by extensive arms transfers by outside governments .
western governments , including those of the united states , britain and canada , have provided billions of dollars worth of weapons and military equipment , as well as intelligence and logistics support , to the coalition , which has been waging an extensive bombing campaign against the houthis .

obama : hello chicago !
( applause ) thank you , everybody !
( applause ) thank you .
( applause ) thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
( applause ) you can tell that i â€™ m a lame duck , because nobody is following instructions .
( laughter ) everybody have a seat .
my fellow americans , michelle and i have been so touched by all the that we â€™ ve received over the past few weeks .
and it â€™ s not just my belief .
it â€™ s what pushed women to reach for the ballot .
yes , our progress has been uneven .
it has been contentious .
sometimes it has been bloody .
but the long sweep of america has been defined by forward motion , a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all , and not just some .
but that â€™ s what we did .
that â€™ s what you did .
no , no , no , no , no .
we have what we need to do so .
understand democracy does not require uniformity .
our founders argued , they quarreled , and eventually they compromised .
but they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity .
poverty is falling again .
but stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic idea .
convinced that the game is fixed against them .
that â€™ s a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics .
now there â€™ re no quick fixes to this trend .
i agree , our trade should be fair and not just free .
.. ( applause ) .
but we can â€™ t be complacent about the goals themselves .
after my election there was talk of a america .
.. ( applause ) .
.. and often divisive force in our society .
( applause ) you can see it not just in statistics .
but we â€™ re not where we need to be .
( applause ) and we have shown that our economy doesn â€™ t have to be a game .
but laws alone won â€™ t be enough .
and as it turned out , america wasn â€™ t weakened by the presence of these newcomers these newcomers embraced this nation â€™ s creed , and this nation was strengthened .
( applause ) so regardless of the station we occupy we all have to try harder we all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do that they value hard work and family just like we do that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own .
( applause ) ( cheering ) and that â€™ s not easy to do .
that â€™ s how our democracy was designed .
in the course of a healthy debate , we prioritize different goals , and the different means of reaching them .
how can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on for kids , but not when we â€™ re cutting taxes for corporations ?
it â€™ s not just dishonest , it â€™ s selective sorting of the facts .
( applause ) but without bolder action , our children won â€™ t have time to debate the existence of climate change .
they â€™ ll be busy dealing with its effects .
the spirit that took flight at kitty hawk and cape canaveral , the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket , it â€™ s that spirit .
an intolerance of dissent and free thought .
a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what â€™ s true and what â€™ s right .
because of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform .
.. ( applause ) .
( cheers ) ( applause ) and although .
.. ( applause ) .
isil will be destroyed .
( applause ) and that â€™ s why for the past eight years i â€™ ve worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing .
( applause ) that â€™ s why i reject discrimination against muslim americans .
.. ( cheers ) .
.. who are just as patriotic as we are .
( cheers ) ( applause ) that â€™ s why .
.. ( applause ) that â€™ s why we can not withdraw .
( applause ) no matter how imperfect our efforts , no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem , that â€™ s part of defending america .
for the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression .
so let â€™ s be vigilant , but not afraid .
isil will try to kill innocent people .
but they can not defeat america unless we betray our constitution and our principles in the fight .
( applause ) when trust in our institutions is low , we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics , and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service .
when congress is dysfunctional , we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes .
( applause ) but remember , none of this happens on its own .
our constitution is a remarkable , beautiful gift .
but it â€™ s really just a piece of parchment .
it has no power on its own .
whether or not we stand up for our freedoms .
whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law , that â€™ s up to us .
america is no fragile thing .
but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured .
.. to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth .
so coarse with rancor that americans with whom we disagree are seen , not just as misguided , but as malevolent .
( crowd cheers ) it falls to each of us to be those anxious , jealous guardians of our democracy .
( applause ) citizen .
it needs you .
not just when there â€™ s an election , not just when you own narrow interest is at stake , but over the full span of a lifetime .
( applause ) if something needs fixing , then lace up your shoes and do some organizing .
( crowd cheers ) show up , dive in , stay at it .
presuming a reservoir in goodness , that can be a risk .
and there will be times when the process will disappoint you .
and more often than not , your faith in america and in americans will be confirmed .
mine sure has been .
i have mourned with grieving families searching for answers , and found grace in a charleston church .
i â€™ ve seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks .
i â€™ ve seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and , above all , to look out for each other .
and i hope your faith has too .

you guarded against cynicism .
( applause ) you did .
and that â€™ s why i leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started .
you believe in a fair , and just , and inclusive america you know that constant change has been america â€™ s hallmark , that it â€™ s not something to fear but something to embrace , you are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward .

even so , 45 percent of fliers said they would buy a â€œ basic economy â€ fare .
and those travelers aren â€™ t necessarily strapped for cash : some 39 percent of fliers earning $ 100 , 000 or more told morning consult that they were likely to purchase a basic economy ticket .
let â€™ s begin with united â€™ s new fares .
if you buy one of united â€™ s â€œ basic economy â€ fares , you can bring along a personal item like a laptop bag or backpack that is 9 inches by 10 inches by 17 inches or less , but not luggage ( hence why you â€™ re not given access to the overhead bins ) .

spirit airlines and wizz air also charge for luggage .
take frontier .
indeed , the latest segmentation of economy fares into seats and premium seats began with delta air lines and has since been adopted by american airlines and united .
if travelers take to united â€™ s basic economy fares , expect the practice to become more widespread .
each airline has its own rules .
and baggage allowances may vary across routes and cabin classes .
5 x 13 .
5 x 7 .

but following a media hullabaloo , the guidelines were not widely adopted .
major airlines â€” american , delta , united , jetblue airways , cathay pacific â€” have set their maximum size for economy passengers at 22 x 14 x 9 inches .
some airlines have stricter rules or slightly different measurements ( or a maximum of linear inches ) .
for example , the maximum size for economy passengers on klm royal dutch airlines is 21 .
5 x 13 .
5 x 10 inches and qatar airways is 20 x 15 x 10 inches .
if you fly multiple airlines and want to travel the world with only one bag , you â€™ ll want to buy one that â€™ s as small as possible .
ryanair passengers who want to be assured that their bag will make it on board can buy one of the airline â€™ s approved bags sold on its website ( wheelies are $ 69 or $ 99 ) .
second , consumer reports , a nonprofit , independent organization , gives some good advice : measure a bag before buying it .
why ?

262,17579 , you â€™ d be surprised at how many foods contain added sugar - the new york times , new york times , margot sanger-katz,2017-06-15,2017.0,6.0 , , '' you may know there â€™ s added sugar in your coke or cookies .
but did you know that it â€™ s in your salad dressing , pasta sauce and bread ?
the change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food â€” like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt â€” and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors â€” like the â€œ evaporated cane juice â€ in a chobani kids strawberry yogurt .
when they looked at every individual processed food in the store , 68 percent had added sugar .
some of those products are more obvious sugary foods , but not all .
you might think it â€™ s easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food , but it isn â€™ t always so .
but there are also things like the â€œ evaporated cane juice â€ in the yogurt , and â€œ rice syrup â€ and â€œ â€ which are less obvious and amount to the same thing .
some are also cheaper than others .
there â€™ s also the matter of fruit juice concentrates , which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated .
a lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like â€œ apple juice concentrate .
â€ that â€™ s sugar .
that will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated .
â€œ it â€™ s going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores , when they find that all this natural food they â€™ ve been buying is full of added sugar , â€ mr. popkin said .
according to the regulation , hidden added sugars make it difficult to understand whether the food you are eating is part of that healthy pattern .
critics of the policy argue that the difference between natural and added sugars is not nutritionally meaningful , and that the science establishing health harms from added sugar is weak .
but measuring the precise amount of sugars that are added with the current label is quite difficult .

there was no room in his worldview for randomness , only purpose and praise .
then he caught tuberculosis and died at 30 .
â€ the science of human origins was not a science the assumption was that our ancestors had always looked like us , all the way back to adam .
instead of being the remains of an atypical human , they might have belonged to a typical member of an alternate humanity .
he called it homo neanderthalensis : neanderthal man .
who was neanderthal man ?
king felt obligated to describe him .
â€ no living humans had skeletal features remotely like these , but king was under the impression that the skulls of contemporary african and australian aboriginals resembled the neanderthals â€™ more than â€œ ordinary â€ skulls .
so extrapolating from his low opinion of what he called these â€œ savage â€ races , he explained that the neanderthal â€™ s skull alone was proof of its moral â€œ darkness â€ and stupidity .
other scientists piled on .
so did the popular press .
â€ while king was working , another british scientist , george busk , had the same suspicions about the neander skull .
its brow ridge wasn â€™ t as prominent as the neander skull â€™ s , and its features were less imposing it was a woman â€™ s skull , it turns out .
that â€™ s what happened to the neanderthals .
and it â€™ s what we did to them .
but recently , after we â€™ d snickered over their skulls for so long , it stopped being clear who the boneheads were .
or rather , i was sure i knew what gibraltar was , but i was wrong .
true , i was traveling to gibraltar on short notice when i the director of the gibraltar museum , clive finlayson , he told me the museum happened to be starting its annual excavation of a neanderthal cave there the following week and invited me to join .
i pictured myself and finlayson taking a special little boat .
it â€™ s a lively british overseas territory , with 30 , 000 citizens living in a city on its western side â€” a city with bakeries and clothing stores and tourists buying all the usual kitsch .
british forever !
this wasn â€™ t just mischief .
it was regarded as an act of symbolic terrorism .
i happened to arrive in gibraltar the week of the brexit vote .
but in gibraltar â€” a fully detached nib of britain , flanked by water on two sides and spain on the third â€” the question was less philosophical : if the united kingdom left the european union , spain might seize the opportunity to isolate gibraltar , leaving the territory to shrivel up , like a flap of dead skin .
there was concern that spain would jam up the border again and that it might happen right away .
around town , â€œ remain â€ signs hung everywhere .
clearly it was happening back home in america too .
gorham â€™ s cave is on gibraltar â€™ s eastern coast : a tremendous opening at the bottom of the sheer face of the rock , shadowy and like a cathedral .
it tapers asymmetrically like a crumpled wizard â€™ s hat .
the dune is enormous .
we â€™ re beginning to understand these people after a century of putting them down as apelike brutes .
â€ neanderthals are people , too â€” a separate , branch of our family tree .
then our evolutionary trajectory split .
we evolved in africa , while the neanderthals would live in europe and asia for 300 , 000 years .
â€ ) what is clearer is that roughly 40 , 000 years ago , just as our own lineage expanded from africa and took over eurasia , the neanderthals disappeared .
scientists have always assumed that the timing wasn â€™ t coincidental .
but neanderthals weren â€™ t the louts we â€™ ve imagined them to be â€” not just a bunch of neanderthals .
neanderthals buried their dead .
in gibraltar , there â€™ s evidence that neanderthals extracted the feathers of certain birds â€” only dark feathers â€” possibly for aesthetic or ceremonial purposes .
and while neanderthals were once presumed to be crude scavengers , we now know they exploited the different terrains on which they lived .
they took down dangerous game , including an extinct species of rhinoceros .
some ate seals and other marine mammals .
some ate shellfish .
some ate chamomile .
( they had regional cuisines . )
wearing feathers , eating seals â€” maybe none of this sounds particularly impressive .
but it â€™ s what our human ancestors were capable of back then too , and scientists have always considered such behavioral flexibility and complexity as signs of our specialness .
the real surprise of these discoveries may not be the competence of neanderthals but how obnoxiously low our expectations for them have been â€” the bias with which too many scientists approached that other us .
a black band of charcoal ran through it .
the students worked scrupulously , watching for small animal bones or artifacts .
smaller bones caught in the sieve were bagged and labeled .
even the sand that passed through the sieve was saved and driven back to a lab at the museum , where i would later find three other students picking through it with magnifying glasses and tweezers , searching for tinier stuff â€” rodent teeth , spines â€” while listening to â€œ call me maybe .
then jennings waved wordlessly at the rest of the cave .
there was also vanguard cave next door , an even more promising site , because while gorham â€™ s had been partly excavated by less meticulous scientists in the 1940s and â€™ 50s , finlayson â€™ s team was the first to touch vanguard .
the â€œ resolution â€ of the caves was incredible the wind blew sand in so fast that it preserved short periods , faithfully , like entries in a diary .
finlayson has described it as â€œ the longest and most detailed record of [ neanderthals â€™ ] way of life that is currently available .
so yes , jennings was right : there was a lot of cave left to dig through .
and most of that haystack was now inaccessible forever .
â€œ the fire and the charcoal , the embers scattering .
â€ it was true .
this wasn â€™ t just a â€œ hearth , â€ i realized it was a campfire .
finlayson began narrating the scene for me .
after they went to sleep and the fire died out , a hyena slinked in to scavenge scraps from the ashes and took a poop .
they let me touch it .
in 1911 , boule began publishing his analysis of the first nearly complete neanderthal skeleton ever discovered , which he named old man of la chapelle , after the limestone cave where it was found .
laboring to reconstruct the old man â€™ s anatomy , he deduced that its head must have been slouched forward , its spine hunched and its toes spread like an ape â€™ s .
the evolution of that science was haphazard and often comically unscientific .
an exhaustive history by erik trinkaus and pat shipman describes how neanderthals became â€œ mirrors that reflected , in all their awfulness and awesomeness , the nature and humanity of those who touched them .
for keith , the replacement of an ancient , inferior species like neanderthals by newer , heartier homo sapiens proved that britain â€™ s actions in australia â€” â€œ the white man .
almost every archaeologist i interviewed complained that the field has become â€œ overinterpreted â€ â€” that the ratio of physical evidence to speculation about that evidence is out of whack .
the washington university anthropologist erik trinkaus , who began his career in the early â€™ 70s , told me , â€œ when i started working on neanderthals , nobody really cared about them .
scientists called this question â€œ the neanderthal problem .
for decades , when evidence of a more advanced neanderthal way of life turned up , it was often explained away , or mobbed by enough contrary or undermining interpretations that , over time , it never found real purchase .
some findings broke through more than others , however , like the discovery of what was essentially a small neanderthal cemetery , in shanidar cave , in what is now iraqi kurdistan .
there had been many compelling instances of neanderthals â€™ burying their dead , but shanidar was harder to ignore , especially after soil samples revealed the presence of huge amounts of pollen .
this was interpreted as the remains of a funerary floral arrangement .
â€ it was 1971 â€” the age of aquarius .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ then again , solecki â€™ s idea was eventually discredited .
in 1999 , a more thorough analysis of the shanidar grave site found that neanderthals almost certainly did not leave flowers there .
it might not have been gerbils it may have been bees . )
as more supposed anomalies surfaced , they became harder to brush off .
now hublin â€™ s analysis identified the bone as belonging to a neanderthal .
â€ papers were fired back and forth , igniting what zilhÃ£o calls â€œ a war â€ and counting .
then , in the middle of that war , geneticists shook up the paradigm completely .
their findings were published in 2010 .
the data shows that we also apparently bred with other hominids , like the denisovans , about which very little is known .
he joked : â€œ their aura is kind of miraculous .
then again , it â€™ s also possible that some of the interbreeding was forced .
lunch happened at the mouth of gorham â€™ s cave , out in the sun .
the bag had been there for a long , long time , jennings told me .
then he turned and uttered , â€œ cinco aÃ±os ? â€ gutiÃ©rrez lÃ³pez smiled .
i , meanwhile , felt compelled to test out all of this as a model for relations .
â€ homo sapiens encountering neanderthals would have been different : they met uncoupled from politics and history neither identified as part of a network of millions of supposedly more advanced people .
in another , they may have made love .
in another , they ignored each other .
â€ it â€™ s a kind of coexistence that our modern imaginations may no longer be sensitive enough to envision .
but that narcissistic is an exceedingly recent privilege .
â€œ the past 20 or 30 millennia , however , have been the exception .
and we had a big head start .
the fauna that neanderthals subsisted on kept migrating away , faster than they could .
â€œ it was luck .
â€ we didn â€™ t defeat the neanderthals we just swamped them .
they were scientific reconstructions , extrapolated by artists from casts of actual fossils .
they were called nana and flint .
he was himself behind her leg , as kids do , but also stared out , straight at us , slightly alarmed , or helpless .
he had commissioned the neanderthals from dutch artists known as kennis kennis , and he was initially taken aback by the woman â€™ s posture in their sketches .
but kennis kennis barraged him with ethnographic photos : real people standing just like this , or even more strangely , their hands behind their necks or slung over their heads .
kennis kennis appeared to be major players in the tiny field of paleolithic reconstruction .
â€œ hyperactive .
like rubber balls .
they are sturdy , attractive men , with dark , wildly swirling hair , and live in the small dutch city of arnhem , southeast of amsterdam .
kennis kennis had gradually adrie â€™ s house as a second studio .
the heads were frighteningly realistic , with glass eyes and fleshy faces that begged to be touched .
when the brothers fly around europe to pitch to museums , they take these heads with them , like salesmen â€™ s samples .
â€œ on the airplane !
we have heads ! â€ adrie shouted .
â€œ they scan things ! â€ alfons shouted .
adrie held the head in his palm and hollered , â€œ bowling ! â€ while pretending to bowl with it .
then he laughed and laughed and laughed .
it emerged as a jovial , old man , with woefulness , or maybe just exhaustion , behind his eyes .
â€ alfons added : â€œ neanderthal neat freaks !
neanderthal bill gates !
they spent a lot of time at their parents â€™ restaurant , after school and on weekends : with nothing to do , they started drawing neanderthals .
they wouldn â€™ t .
initially they were painters , not sculptors .
geneticists can suggest a probable scope of skin and hair colors .
â€œ every culture does something with their hair ! â€ alfons insisted .
â€œ there â€™ s no culture that does nothing with their hair .
these were some of the same photos they had shown finlayson .
â€œ all this variation !
he had to look : these were reaches of reality that our minds didn â€™ t travel to on their own .
â€ they showed me more photos .
â€œ it â€™ s real , it â€™ s real , it â€™ s real ! â€ alfons kept shouting .
a tide of specialists flowed into gorham â€™ s .
in controlled experiments , it took between 188 and 317 strokes with a flint tool to create the entire figure .
you can call that art , if you like .
â€ the finding was published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in 2014 .
â€ but several archaeologists told me they believe that there are many clearer signs of neanderthals â€™ capacity for complex cognition and symbolism , including a discovery in southern france last year that seemed to dwarf the hashtag â€™ s significance .
but finlayson was undaunted .
he turned the hashtag into a logo for the rebranding of his museum .
there was a hashtag decal on the van he picked me up in every morning .
we stood and talked for a while until , finally , with richard aplomb , finlayson lifted a tarp and showed it to me .
and the location of the fire was also puzzling : neanderthals usually situated fires at the fronts of caves , to control smoke .
â€ we flung our heads back : a chute coursed through the high , craggy ceiling above us .
for all i knew , the hashtag marked his or her favorite seat .
but finlayson wasn â€™ t done .
and they left offerings back here there were shards of their ceramics under the catwalk we had just crossed .
gorham didn â€™ t discover gorham â€™ s cave , finlayson told me it had always been impossible to miss .
â€œ that â€™ s really gorham â€™ s cave .
you are showing yourselves in all your meanspirited , elitist glory .
â€ when i read that , i took genuine umbrage â€” but on the neanderthals â€™ behalf .
and while i hate to admit it , i also felt a cheap but delicious tingle of smugness , because i now knew that â€œ neanderthal â€ wasn â€™ t the insult hurley thought it was â€” though this , i simultaneously realized , also closed a certain loop and promoted , in me , the very elitist glory hurley was incensed by , thus deepening the divide .

283,17601 , senate takes major step toward repealing health care law - the new york times , new york times , thomas kaplan and robert pear,2017-01-19,2017.0,1.0 , , '' washington â€” senate republicans took their first major step toward repealing the affordable care act on thursday , approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a democratic filibuster .

in the parlance of capitol hill , many of the democrats â€™ proposals were â€œ messaging amendments , â€ intended to put republicans on record as opposing popular provisions of the affordable care act .
as the senate plowed through its work on wednesday , republicans explained why they were determined to dismantle the health care law , and they tried to assuage concerns about the future of coverage for millions of americans .
â€ republicans do not have an agreement even among themselves on the content of legislation to replace the affordable care act , the timetable for votes on such legislation or its effective date .

about 20 million more americans had insurance last year than before the law passed , according to an obama administration estimate .
most of the g. o. p. plans manage to be less expensive for the federal government â€” by offering stingier federal payments in helping people buy insurance and allowing the coverage people buy to be skimpier .
people will end up paying a larger share of their income to buy coverage than they do under obamacare .
millions to tens of millions fewer americans will have coverage under such plans , according to independent estimates .
healthy people who buy their own insurance have been the most disadvantaged group under obamacare , and their fortunes would improve .
( some sick people may be far worse off .
the affordable care act is a case study in these .

â€ he had been talking for hours on his weekly radio shows ( plural ) as well as negotiating and announcing his new book imprint , andy cohen books .
he had been hosting his nightly live talk show on bravo , â€œ watch what happens live with andy cohen .
â€œ some of them are volatile women .
so it â€™ s all real .
it â€™ s all real .
they had heard their housewife colleagues talk about their behavior in interviews .
s to what they had seen .
she knew she would be held accountable for crimes that included calling teresa a â€œ criminal â€ and accusing teresa â€™ s allies of being her â€œ soldiers .
â€ jacqueline knew she just had to endure it .
she has stopped trying to game cohen at these things .
â€œ i â€™ m not on a reality show about my life â€ was his answer .
it annoys him , this implication that what he â€™ s doing is somehow cruel to the women who have signed up for it .
but don â€™ t you feel bad for them ?
i wanted to know .
these women , who were once housewives , real housewives , are now businesswomen .
teresa giudice is a new york times author .
jacqueline laurita now has a platform to talk about her son â€™ s autism and for her husband to sell a brand called the little kernel .
â€œ they know what they â€™ re doing .
â€œ let me just see it .
â€ he took his place in the fake living room and sat down .
â€œ stay on your couches ! â€ he beseeched them .
â€œ don â€™ t push daddy ! â€ he put a finger gun to his head as teresa accused jacqueline of selling a story to a tabloid .
â€ cohen has hosted a nightly talk show now for more than seven years that features scintillating conversation with celebrities and ( o. k. yes ) clips of bravo shows , but his guests are legitimate stars , like meryl streep and oprah winfrey and ( o. k. yes ) real housewives .
â€œ real housewives â€ is watched sincerely , it is watched as camp .
â€ i saw a woman flip a table when she was angry , a woman who threw her fake leg when she was angry ( more on this later ) .
â€ but cohen told that man in washington this : â€œ first of all , the â€˜ housewives â€™ are entertainment .
there are consequences to it .
had he seen the polls ?
cohen pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows and tilted his head back and forth in consideration .
â€ i didn â€™ t listen to him .
it â€™ s just like , oh , that â€™ s the â€˜ housewives â€™ guy , who cares ? â€ cohen explained a few weeks after the reunion .
we were at cafe cluny in the west village for lunch in the 3 p. m. hour , which is the approximate time lunch happens for someone who goes to bed at about 2 a. m. each night , often following a massage .
â€œ i think i â€™ m about it , but on the other hand , if that â€™ s what i am , i â€™ m also good with it because it â€™ s a wonderful thing to be .
â€ he took a piece of the chocolate .
or a guy with his own channel on sirius xm radio that features shows with sandra bernhard and dan rather ?
) .
and so he is these days often trying to figure out a metric by which he can ascertain where he falls in the fame food chain .
another tux he likes is being held for johnny depp , which is o. k. with him , because of course johnny depp .
â€œ no .
they â€™ re telling me where i stand .
â€ he paused for a second .
â€œ i have my health .
i have my show .
i have my life .
you know what i mean ? â€ but also , â€œ i think my show is a late show , you know ? â€ don â€™ t read any of this as defeated or bitter .
from a young age , there was something about andy cohen that his mother couldn â€™ t quite put her finger on .
what was it , though ?
what was it ?
and he told her he was .
a mother always knows .
so , just me being me .
in that footage , cohen saw something .
â€œ i was like : â€˜ this is a soap opera .
this is a soap opera .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ it was also something else .
â€œ this is real life .
the â€œ housewives â€ shows usually begin with an introduction of each housewife , posing in grade a evening wear and announcing her tagline , which is part defensive apologia , part mission statement , part brand definition .
i mean maybe all men , too i think all people want to be heard and understood .
i eventually watched the episode of â€œ real housewives of orange county â€ that kathleen french had warned cohen about .
that went right out the window on this trip .
! â€ she also does the old â€œ what â€™ s on your shirt ? â€ and when you look down , she flicks you in the nose .
i â€™ m mexican .
something cohen knows , a belief that began to take root in him back when he was watching â€œ all my children â€ with his mother , was that people who interacted would always create something interesting .
or that it was too crass .
had people been on a subway recently ?
had they read an online comments section ?
it â€™ s all real .
it wouldn â€™ t be compelling to watch if it weren â€™ t .
he wanted to know why everyone he knew was so surprised about all of this .
i â€™ d been watching the show , hadn â€™ t i ?
i â€™ d seen tamra from â€œ orange county â€ call alexis â€œ jesus jugs , â€ hadn â€™ t i ?
how was that different from calling hillary clinton â€œ crooked hillary â€ ?
â€œ wouldn â€™ t that be the province of the housewives if they were men ? â€ he was right .
he knew he had to be entertaining to stay on the show .
at the debates , the candidates fought for time to speak and demanded that they be allowed the time they were promised , which is what happens at the reunions .
when cohen saw that , he told me , he thought , lester holt , i feel your pain .
â€ they accuse him of ruining america , when he carries the light .
andy cohen didn â€™ t invent our society .
he simply predicted it .
but it wasn â€™ t .
he is simply a walking seismograph of it .
meeting these guidelines is associated with a substantially reduced risk of developing a wide range of diseases and dying too young .
but many people apparently do not have the time or inclination to exercise five times per week .
there has been little information , though , about whether the weekend warrior pattern of exercise lowers the risk for premature death as effectively as more frequent and generally shorter workouts .
those who did exercise for the full 150 gentle or 75 vigorous weekly minutes were labeled sufficiently active .
those who met the recommendations gained a slight edge in longevity , being about 30 percent less likely to have died than people who never exercised .
it also raises questions it can not answer , including whether weekend warriors might be missing out on other potential health gains from exercise .
and they are likely to face a higher risk of injuries than people who exercise more often .

then his work was excluded from the gwangju biennale , south korea â€™ s international arts festival , an act gwangju â€™ s mayor later admitted was due to government pressure .
a 2015 version of the list included more than 9 , 000 people , according to news reports .
the list contained some of south korea â€™ s most beloved filmmakers , actors and writers , including the director of â€œ oldboy , â€ park and the â€œ snowpiercer â€ actor song .
both ms. park and mr. kim , her former chief of staff , have denied involvement .
â€ for many south koreans , news of the blacklisting of artists reawakened memories from the nation â€™ s dictatorial past .
ms. park â€™ s father , who ruled south korea from 1961 to 1979 , censored newspapers and imprisoned dissident writers and publishers .
( both were bald . )
under ms. park â€™ s conservative predecessor , lee some celebrities and journalists deemed progressive were barred from broadcasters .
â€œ this shows how disgusting the government is .
last month , a former aide to ms. park was indicted on charges of colluding with her in an attempt to blackmail a vice chairwoman of cj , which runs south korea â€™ s biggest film studio , into retiring in 2013 .
â€œ i thought this kind of thing happened only under the past military rule , â€ cj â€™ s chairman , sohn told a parliamentary hearing last month .
mr. yoo said that an early version of the blacklist he saw in june 2014 included hundreds of artists .
( ms. park has denied being warned . )
by 2015 , the list had ballooned to include more than 9 , 000 visual artists , musicians , actors , film and musical directors , and writers deemed critical of ms. park , particularly those who took aim at her handling of the ferry disaster or who were suspected of supporting her rivals , according to the hankook ilbo newspaper , which published what it claimed was the list in october .
ms. park â€™ s office zealously pursued her opponents after the ferry disaster , according to the diary of kim the former presidential aide who detailed the retaliation against mr. hong .
the ferry tragedy is a central motif in mr. hong â€™ s painting .
during a meeting of senior presidential aides in 2014 , mr. kim , ms. park â€™ s chief of staff at the time , called for a â€œ combative response to leftists in the cultural and art circles â€ and ordered the aides to â€œ discover their networks , â€ according to the diary .
he compared progressive teachers and journalists â€œ to poisonous mushrooms .
â€ the diary also recorded instructions to punish artists who satirized ms. park , conduct a â€œ loyalty check â€ of senior government officials , â€œ intimidate â€ courts of law and â€œ induce â€ scholars to write newspaper columns .
in 2015 , mr. hong was invited to show his painting at a berlin arts festival .
mr. hong had to travel alone and hurriedly repaint a copy of the original in berlin .
he also suspected the government was behind a tax audit of his wife â€™ s clinic last year .

justice department negotiators are moving quickly to complete a second investigation in chicago , which has also been wracked by violence and tension between the police and residents .
larry hogan , a republican , called in the national guard to quell riots â€” and appeals for federal intervention .
in the ensuing political fallout , the democratic mayor , stephanie dismissed the police chief and six officers were charged in mr. gray â€™ s death none were convicted .
the episode roiled racial tensions nationwide amid a string of other deaths of black men in police confrontations nationwide , from ferguson , mo .
to staten island .
the justice department filed a consent decree in federal court on thursday just minutes before announcing the deal .
â€ the agreement requires officers to go through 80 hours of training in practices like community policing and proper tactics for stops , searches and arrests .
the findings also painted a picture of a police culture deeply dismissive of sexual assault victims and hostile toward prostitutes and transgender people .
the decree â€™ s requirements are intended to prohibit unlawful stops and arrests , and to prevent discriminatory policing and excessive force .
representative elijah cummings , a maryland democrat , called the agreement â€œ a chance to trust â€ between residents and the police after a painful few years .
â€œ but at the same time , â€ mr. jaros added , â€œ it â€™ s ambiguous as to what its reach is , â€ and whether it limits police actions further than existing law does .

294,17613 , the billionaire art dealer guy wildenstein is cleared of tax fraud - the new york times , new york times , doreen carvajal,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0 , , '' paris â€” in a surprise verdict , a french tribunal of judges cleared guy wildenstein â€” the patriarch of an international dynasty â€” of charges that he laundered money by shielding a precious collection in a maze of foreign trusts to avoid inheritance taxes .
olivier gÃ©ron , the lead judge who had presided over the trial last fall , announced the decision thursday at the palais de justice .
the authorities had sought a 250 million euro fine ( about $ 267 million ) for mr. wildenstein , 71 , who is president of wildenstein company , a new york art gallery .
the case also ensnared his nephew and his estranged along with swiss and french legal advisers and foreign trust companies .
the french media had also labeled the wildensteins the â€œ impressionists of finance , â€ a reference to the family â€™ s deep collection of art , which included works by bonnard , fragonard , caravaggio , poussin and watteau .
mr. wildenstein was not in court for the verdict .
mr. wildenstein â€™ s legal team had argued at trial that he was unaware of the complex terms of the trusts managed by legal advisers .
mr. wildenstein was accused of underestimating inheritance taxes after his father , daniel , died at the age of 84 in 2001 , in france .
prosecutors contend that mr. wildenstein and his brother , alec , schemed to hide art and assets under the complex trusts and moved millions of dollars in artworks to tax havens in switzerland days after their father died .
sylvia wildenstein , daniel â€™ s widow , sued her stepsons over his estate , contending that assets had been hidden from her in the trusts .
outside the courtroom , a lawyer for mr. wildenstein trailed mrs. wildenstein â€™ s former lawyer , claude and loudly called the lawyer a â€œ crook â€ while she spoke with reporters .
mr. wildenstein still faces other legal hurdles in civil court , including the claims by the state for about â‚¬500 million ( about $ 534 million ) in back taxes and other complaints rising from works seized by the police from the vaults of the wildenstein institute in paris because the ownership was not clear .
â€ this follows earlier decisions to separate her personal social media accounts from those of her brand .
in case , you know , anyone wanted to buy the garment .
so she probably has a lot of such products within reach .
whether or not they are technically linked .
and an endorsement is exactly what an appearance in an item of clothing has become .
she is smart enough to know that any time she steps out of her door , someone is going to try to snap a picture and parse her clothes .
though to be fair , the brand â€™ s website is adorned with images and line drawings of many different kinds of women and not with ms. trump , so it may be possible .
either way , this is another illustration of the multiple complicated issues that are going to arise with a member of the first family who also had designs on being a fashion brand .
he exulted over the wins .
after losses , he was so angry that he couldn â€™ t speak .

why aren â€™ t you excited ?
don â€™ t just do it because you feel like you should be doing it .
for reasons that may go unquestioned , they stick with it , no matter the emotional toll .
once doubt takes hold , they wonder why they spend so much time and emotion on mere games .

she became pregnant at 18 with her daughter deandra .

â€œ i should know .
but it seems like a good time to look at the major changes obamacare brought to health care , which of those changes may now disappear , and what might replace them .
the health law reduced the number of uninsured americans by an estimated 20 million people from 2010 to 2016 .
this would make insurance unaffordable for millions of americans and sharply reduce the number who buy their own health coverage .
with many fewer people buying coverage , the insurance markets are likely to become increasingly unstable .

republicans would also like to expand tax incentives for people to save money for health expenses .
many of the republican proposals would also establish pools , which would provide subsidized insurance options for people with chronic health problems who wouldn â€™ t be able to buy insurance without rules forcing insurers to sell them coverage .
some experts think that eliminating the individual mandate , in particular , could destabilize insurance markets by reducing incentives for healthy people to buy coverage .

the night â€” sept. 15 â€” was actually quite chilly .
â€ but there was a dark subtext to the comedy .
ms. monroe was not happy her husband had shown up .
but he was even more unhappy and angrily stormed off .
later that night the couple had a screaming fight in their room .
three weeks later , ms. monroe filed for divorce .
except for some brief , grainy shots from a newsreel covering the divorce , footage from that night was never screened .
his granddaughter bonnie siegler said he bragged from time to time about his personal film shoot with marilyn .
â€œ he would be filming everywhere , all the time .
mr. schulback , 25 at the time , urged them to pack their bags and leave berlin with him .
but they resisted , opting to wait and see how things developed , never imagining the horror that awaited them and millions of other european jews .
mr. schulback was not taking any chances .
mr. schulback sold everything he had , bought an expensive suit , booked passage on the queen mary , reserved a room at the plaza and headed to america to find a sponsor for him and his wife , edith , and their daughter helen , who was then a toddler .
â€œ he was like : â€˜ i â€™ m your lost , rich relative .
i won â€™ t be a burden. â€™ but he had no money .
mr. schulback grabbed edith and helen , again imploring his other relatives to leave , and escaped back to the united states with a few suitcases , claiming to the nazi immigration officers that his family was going on vacation .
in berlin , he had been a furrier , and his shop was destroyed that night .
the united states was good to mr. schulback .
from his apartment window , she could see the buckets of doll eyes and doll arms .
but mr. schulback , always a man of action , refused to let his wife die in the hospital and took her home .
the andrew w. mellon foundation had bought the townhouse where he lived and the one behind it and wanted to reconfigure the property .
â€œ but when we went in , we found this plastic bag filled with just tons of film , home movies , bought movies and everything mixed together .
â€ ms. siegler â€™ s husband , an experimental filmmaker , couldn â€™ t wait to screen the films .
â€œ dimaggio , â€ dr .
a third theory was that the footage was too risquÃ© and ms. monroe wanted to shoot a more demure version , so as not to further infuriate her husband .
there was even talk at the time that she wasn â€™ t wearing any underwear .
mr. wilder tried to put those rumors to rest in his biography .

back in the pelt room of mr. schulback â€™ s apartment , mr. scher excitedly gathered up the old metal film canisters .
none were labeled , mr. scher recalled .
there were the family outings and parades .
the birthdays and bar mitzvahs .
and there , amid the mundane scenes of precious everyday life , was marilyn monroe , in crisp , colorful kodachrome .
â€œ it was real !
preserved like the home movies are , too .
just these moments in time .
â€œ it was startling .
like seeing a myth materialize .
mr. scher called out to his wife : â€œ it â€™ s really here ! â€ they watched all 3 minutes 17 seconds in amazement .
and there it was .
it was the earlier scene â€” before the subway grate footage â€” that mr. schulback had shot .
cameramen and press photographers are gathered outside as the actress smiles and waves .
cut to ms. monroe in a window wearing a slip and her hair .
â€ and suddenly , there is ms. monroe again , this time on the subway grate in that famously fluttering white dress , holding a matching white clutch in her right hand and a scarf in her left .
now and then , a silhouette of the director â€™ s arm intrudes into mr. schulback â€™ s shot .
then mr. ewell is there , chatting with ms. monroe , who pushes him into position .
the dress flutters again , ms. monroe holds it down , bending slightly , smiling and talking to mr. ewell , but it flutters up some more and she laughs , her head thrown back .
then , as suddenly as she appeared , marilyn is gone , and the film reverts to mode : edith schulback walking on the grass at a family outing in the country .
it â€™ s like being shaken from some crazy dream , back to reality .
banner , the monroe biographer .
â€ she shrugged .
â€ mr. schulback moved in 2005 and died six months later .
â€œ so to have film of it actually being shot , it â€™ s like watching the zapruder film .
it â€™ s just extraordinary .
â€ the crowd that evening sat in silence as marilyn monroe â€™ s dress blew up on the side of the barn .
â€œ they were like , â€˜ what did i just see ?
â€™ â€ that was the only time anyone outside the family had seen the film .

there is little doubt that investigators will lean on suspects to testify against others , and push as high up in volkswagen â€™ s organization chart as the evidence allows .
the $ 20 billion that volkswagen is paying to resolve civil and criminal charges â€” including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to defraud the united states government â€” is unlikely to be the end of the story .
shareholder lawsuits in the united states and europe could cost an additional $ 10 billion .
united states authorities also signaled that investigators will not be constrained by national boundaries .
the cost of the united states settlements drains cash that volkswagen urgently needs to adapt to technological upheaval .
as part of an agreement that calls for volkswagen to pay $ 4 .
3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to violations of the clean air act , the company signed off on a detailed account of how the cheating software came into being , and how volkswagen employees tried to cover it up after regulators â€™ suspicions were aroused .
the account of the wrongdoing reinforces the view that volkswagen corporate culture was seriously awry .
instead of coming clean after regulators began asking questions in 2014 , volkswagen executives mounted a .
shareholders in the united states and europe have filed lawsuits saying volkswagen had a duty to warn much sooner of the potential financial havoc that would be caused by the official investigations .
further charges could also wreak havoc on the upper ranks .
there was some good news for volkswagen .
the maximum penalty just for the criminal violations would have been $ 34 billion , according to department of justice calculations .
volkswagen received a discount for being cooperative after its initial stonewalling , and for the nearly $ 16 billion it is paying to owners of volkswagen diesels , dealers and others as compensation .
the deal was the product of weeks of negotiations by representatives for the government and volkswagen , all of whom were eager to resolve the case before donald j. trump takes office .
volkswagen sales have been holding up even though the company â€™ s reputation has taken a beating .
volkswagen said this week that it sold 10 .
3 million vehicles worldwide in 2016 , a 4 percent increase over 2015 .
sales of volkswagen brand cars fell 8 percent last year to 323 , 000 vehicles , though there were signs of a rebound toward the end of the year .

it may seem odd that it took a century when the inspiration was right under their noses : s â€™ mores .
as connoisseurs know , there are regional variations in the popular thin mint cookies , and strong similarities between samoas and caramel delites .
neither of the s â€™ mores has been seared over embers under the stars , as prescribed in that 1927 recipe for â€œ some more .
â€ but early taste tests online , and among the new york times â€™ s food staff , showed a slight preference for the sandwich cookie , for its balanced sweetness and tender , fudgelike center .
councils in los angeles and new york will sell the sandwich cookies , while those in philadelphia and orange county , calif. will sell the grahams .
this may not matter to thin mint purists , but not every council will have a s â€™ mores cookie on the menu .
since then , this business has expanded to become a national phenomenon , with devoted fans buying cult flavors in bulk , or stashing extra boxes in the freezer to last until the next cookie season .

329,17653 , in the shopping cart of a food stamp household : lots of soda - the new york times , new york times , anahad o â€™ connor,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0 , , '' what do households on food stamps buy at the grocery store ?
the answer was largely a mystery until now .
the united states department of agriculture , which oversees the $ 74 billion food stamp program called snap , has published a detailed report that provides a glimpse into the shopping cart of the typical household that receives food stamps .
the findings show that the no .
1 purchases by snap households are soft drinks , which accounted for 5 percent of the dollars they spent on food .
the category of â€˜ sweetened beverages , â€™ which includes soft drinks , fruit juices , energy drinks and sweetened teas , accounted for almost 10 percent of the dollars they spent on food .
â€œ it â€™ s pretty shocking .
specifically , they have called for restrictions so that food stamps can not be used to buy junk food or sugary soft drinks .
but the food and beverage industries have spent millions opposing such measures , and the u. s. d. a. has denied every request , saying that selectively banning certain foods would be unfair to food stamp users and create too much red tape .
while the report , published recently , suggests that a disproportionate amount of food stamp money is going toward unhealthful foods , the u. s. d. a. said it was unfair to single out food stamp recipients for their soft drink consumption .
while those who used food stamps bought slightly more junk food and fewer vegetables , both snap and households bought ample amounts of sweetened drinks , candy , ice cream and potato chips .
among households , for example , soft drinks ranked second on the list of food purchases , behind milk .
â€œ this report raises a question for all households : are we consuming too many sweetened beverages , period ? â€ the report was based on data from an unnamed , nationwide grocery chain , which provided the u. s. d. a. with monthly records of food items bought in 2011 by more than 26 million households , about three million of them food stamp recipients .
nonetheless , the report provides a striking look at the foods american households typically buy .
it indicated that all americans bought ample amounts of desserts , salty snacks , candy and other junk foods .
but the snap households spent slightly less money on nutritious foods , including fruits and vegetables , beans , eggs , nuts and seeds .
over all , the report found , snap households spent about 40 cents of every dollar at the grocery store on â€œ basic items â€ like meat , fruits , vegetables , milk , eggs and bread .
another 40 cents of every dollar was spent on â€œ cereal , prepared foods , dairy products , rice and beans .
â€ lastly , 20 cents of each dollar was spent on a broad category of junk foods that included â€œ sweetened beverages , desserts , salty snacks , candy and sugar .
â€ snap households spent 9 .
1 percent figure for households that do not receive food stamps .
the u. s. d. a. concluded that both food stamp recipients and other households generally made similar purchases .
â€ the federal government provides snap benefits to roughly 23 million households each month , many of them homes at or below the poverty line .
that means a household that spent 10 percent of its snap money on sweetened beverages could buy at least 20 bottles of orange crush soda at a fine fare supermarket in new york city , or about 50 cans of sprite at a walmart near oakland , calif .
but doing so requires permission from the u. s. d. a. and the agency has denied every official request .
pepsico lobbied the federal government to prevent restrictions on food stamp purchases in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 , according to the center for responsive politics , a nonprofit that tracks money in politics .
kraft foods and the sugar industry lobbied against a florida bill in 2012 that would have banned using food stamps to buy soda and junk food .
and in 2011 , the snack food association teamed up with beverage industry lobbyists and the national confectioners association , which represents candy companies , to defeat new york city â€™ s proposed ban on using food stamps to buy beverages .
the federal farm bill that designates money for the snap program , for example , set aside $ 100 million for programs that increase the value of food stamps that are used to buy fruits and vegetables at retail stores or farmers â€™ markets .
while there is evidence that people do buy more fruits and vegetables when given incentives , research suggests that banning sugary drinks would have a far more powerful impact on health .

seattle â€™ s devin hester , who has returned 19 kickoffs and punts for touchdowns during his career , caught the kick , spun away from a defender , then sprinted down the sideline before being knocked out of bounds deep in falcons territory .
after the ensuing kickoff , falcons quarterback matt ryan quickly hit receiver taylor gabriel for 37 yards .

on saturday , the reverse was true .
it also bottled up running back thomas rawls , who ran effectively early in the game but ended with just 34 yards , 15 fewer than wilson .
after nearly being burned by hester in the second quarter , the falcons did a good job of keeping the ball away from him â€” until he returned a kickoff all the way to the atlanta line , setting up seattle â€™ s final touchdown .
he raced for the marker only to be hit hard by atlanta cornerback brian poole , who drove his shoulder into wilson and threw him to the ground .
and it was the falcons â€™ defense that ultimately provided the capstone .
midway through the fourth quarter , wilson was again forced to run out of the pocket .

those two men , john zahurancik , a science fiction fan , and chris shelton , a former physics teacher , had started talking about batteries a decade ago , before electric cars became fashionable or even feasible .
the trick would be to figure out how to harness all that power , which creates heat , while avoiding the fires such batteries have caused in any number of vehicles and gadgets , including teslas , hp computers , hoverboards and , most recently , samsung galaxy note 7s .
mr. zahurancik , who owns the gong , is now president of aes energy storage .
aes does not actually make its batteries but buys them , along with other equipment , from manufacturers like samsung , lg chem and panasonic .

â€ those extracts were not explicit on the single market or the customs union , but the sunday newspapers , which receive their own briefings from the government before publication , took much the same line : that britain is headed for a sharp break with europe after a transitional period .
downing street dislikes the term â€œ hard brexit , â€ but an outcome along those lines is not unexpected , because it flows logically from the priorities mrs. may has set out , particularly about controlling the country â€™ s borders .
a week ago , mrs. may said in a television interview that britain would not be able to keep â€œ bits â€ of its european union membership .
â€œ we are leaving .
â€ she added , â€œ we will be able to have control of our borders , control of our laws .
â€ but mrs. may â€™ s speech on tuesday , judging from the excerpts , is also meant to assuage european union colleagues by committing britain to a close , friendly and constructive future relationship .
bankers and brokers in the city of london are sometimes reviled by many britons but are also highly paid , so their tax receipts are important to the treasury .
but her officials were not likely to be happy to discover that michael gove , who strongly favored brexit and whom she fired from the cabinet , had secured the first british interview with mr. trump , scheduled to be printed in the times of london on monday .
but as a realist , he is preparing to live with it .
there are signs that companies might be taking action already , ahead of the actual brexit .
â€œ their hands are quivering over the relocate button , â€ he added .
they all rely heavily on workers from southern or eastern europe , whose right to employment here may be curbed to achieve mrs. may â€™ s objective of reducing immigration .
â€ and with the clock now ticking toward a planned departure from the union in 2019 , companies are already having to contemplate that outcome , even before ms. may lays out her intentions on tuesday .
mr. magal is also worried about recruiting engineers , who are in short supply in britain , if new immigration restrictions are put in place .
and he thinks he may have to hire more administrative staff to deal with possible tariffs and other red tape .
6 million vehicles built in britain in 2015 were sold abroad about 57 percent of british car exports go to the european union .

in 2007 , mr. collins was elected county executive of erie county , which includes buffalo , and in 2012 , he won election to congress .
today , many of innate â€™ s biggest shareholders have ties to mr. collins .
lindy ruff , the head coach of the dallas stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the buffalo sabres , is also an investor .
â€ for example , mr. paxon , who represented mr. collins â€™ s congressional district in the 1990s , could appear before mr. collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in innate .
â€œ it â€™ s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians , â€ mr. holman said .
mr. collins â€™ s spokesman said mr. paxon and mr. collins had never discussed innate and noted that , because they are both from the buffalo area , he might have become aware of innate through other investors in the region .

no matter that the couple were living in a rental in downtown brooklyn and had only just begun their search for a westchester county in earnest .
â€ and so , with his wife â€™ s blessing and a warming drawer in the trunk of his car , mr .
bond began his quest for a kitchen on the cheap .
in chatting with the contractor , mr .
â€™ â€ about a month later , mr. bond â€™ s phone rang and he was back in new jersey with a rented and a hand truck , picking up an $ 7 , 400 wine refrigerator for $ 1 , 000 from the same man .
mr .
now his search became strategic .
to match his newly acquired wine refrigerator , a integrated model , mr .
but according to the contractor , he added , â€œ the people who had bought it were like , â€˜ we don â€™ t like this kitchen we just want a new kitchen .
â€™ â€ mr .
bond showed up with cash in hand , in tow .
but with refrigerators normally selling for as much as $ 8 , 000 , he figured , â€œ if i â€™ m buying it for $ 1 , 000 and i put another $ 1 , 500 into it â€” that â€™ s still an incredible savings .
â€œ we just saw a lot of potential , â€ mr .
they closed on the apartment in july 2015 , paying about $ 240 , 000 , and immediately began renovating the kitchen , a process that took about five months .
mr .
bond had in storage .
but his obsession with craigslist did not end .
in search of an elusive miele espresso maker and viking range , he checked his emails nightly .
he admitted he was getting a little carried away when he decided they should buy a range he found online , although they had already agreed on a model .
as it is , we have three refrigerators .
this is not a commercial kitchen .
â€™ â€ putting it more mildly , she added : â€œ he had the best of intentions , but i had to reel him in on the range , because it just didn â€™ t fit and we would have had to rework all of our cabinet sizes .
â€ mr .
bond ended up buying a viking ( normally $ 5 , 000 ) for $ 1 , 500 , even though it was set up for propane and their apartment uses natural gas .
to salvage the deal , he picked up a conversion kit for about $ 50 at a local hardware store and did the installation himself after watching a video on youtube .
then , just as he had resigned himself to drinking regular coffee , a craigslist alert landed in his inbox for a miele espresso maker that normally sold for $ 3 , 500 .
mr .
bond left without the machine , but called a few repair shops and learned that it could be fixed for $ 300 .
although , mr .
bond admitted , â€œ it â€™ s all a little overkill â€” i feel like a food hoarder .

it will be new england â€™ s 11th appearance in the a. f. c. championship game in the 16 seasons of the tom brady era , and the team will be trying to reach the super bowl for the seventh time in that span .
the steelers wasted a tremendous effort by running back le â€™ veon bell , who broke his own franchise postseason record by gaining 170 yards on 30 carries .
despite bell â€™ s success , pittsburgh was forced to turn to chris boswell , the team â€™ s kicker , for a postseason record six field goals , breaking the previous record of five that been accomplished eight times .
pittsburgh â€™ s defense largely eliminated tyreek hill , the chiefs â€™ versatile offensive weapon .
in the end , however , rodgers had just enough to overcome dallas â€™ furious comeback .
ty montgomery , the wide back , chipped in with 11 carries for 47 yards and 2 touchdowns , while also catching 6 passes for 34 yards .
that the game was left to crosby â€™ s strong right leg may have worried some packers fans , but the veteran kicker had an incredible final four minutes of the game .

early conversations with harbaugh , now a super coach in baltimore , inculcated the magnitude of the punt .

the earliest english novels , from â€œ moll flanders â€ ( 1722 ) to â€œ clarissa â€ ( 1748 ) were published anonymously , with titles that implied they were true stories .
it took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue .
the rise of the memoir over the past few decades doesn â€™ t mean that readers are ready to abandon the techniques of fiction but , like readers three centuries ago , they want the freedom of fiction along with consequentiality of fact .
the author david shields diagnosed this desire in his 2010 manifesto â€œ reality hunger â€ : â€œ i find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself as a novel .
ben lerner â€™ s â€œ 10:04 , â€ tao lin â€™ s â€œ taipei â€ and sheila heti â€™ s â€œ how should a person be ? â€ all seek to convince us that we are reading about the writer â€™ s actual life .
but this game has a : label a book â€œ fiction , â€ and all is forgiven .
we lie to ourselves now with a bad conscience .
when the memoir is exposed as not having â€œ really â€ happened , we want our money back .
â€œ the protocols of the elders of zion â€ was published , like â€œ moll flanders , â€ with no name on the title page it , too , claimed to be a true account of real events â€” in this case , a meeting at which jews plotted to take over the world and destroy civilization .
but the â€œ protocols â€ is even more powerful when endorsed by people who know it is false , because such an act turns fact itself into an irrelevance .
the same is true of demagogues .
that â€™ s up for discussion .
â€œ secondly , countries aren â€™ t paying what they should â€ and nato â€œ didn â€™ t deal with terrorism .
mr. trump also criticized the european union , describing it as â€œ basically a vehicle for germany .
beijing responded quickly and decisively .
mr. trump also took aim at german automakers , warning of a 35 percent tariff on any cars they build in mexico and export to the united states .

dmitri s. peskov , a spokesman for president vladimir v. putin of russia , said on monday that â€œ nato is indeed a vestige , â€ according to radio free europe .
that was a danger and a deterrent for the young activists she spoke to .
it also harms society by diminishing public trust .
â€™ â€ degrading that trust can be deeply damaging .
â€ they reacted to all information , whether from official sources or thirdhand rumors , as if it might be true .
but they were also careful not to rely on that information , lest it turn out to be a fabrication .
when it appeared that yasmÃ­n barrios , the judge presiding over the trial of gen. efraÃ­n rÃ­os montt , guatemala â€™ s former dictator , might convict him of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013 , a campaign of coordinated leaks and rumors portrayed her as a corrupt agent of foreign governments , willing to discredit her country in exchange for personal gain .
in fact , the â€œ foreigners â€ were judge barrios â€™ s guatemalan mother , her neighbor , and a nun who was a friend of the family .
but the rumors had their desired effect : they discredited not only judge barrios but also the genocide trial .
( his conviction was later vacated on procedural grounds . )
she listed the parallels to what she had seen in her research : its content is damaging but unverified .

here are excerpts from the conversation , which have been edited and condensed .
some of your favorites ?
or â€œ the woman warrior , â€ by maxine [ hong kingston ] .
have you had a chance to discuss them with her ?
i â€™ ve had the chance to discuss some .
she had just read â€œ a moveable feast .
i loved reading when i was a kid , partly because i was traveling so much , and there were times where i â€™ d be displaced , i â€™ d be the outsider .
i think all of us did .
yeah .
i was hermetic â€” it really is true .
and i was very intense , and sort of humorless .
what were your short stories like ?
it â€™ s interesting , when i read them , a lot of them had to do with older people .
they were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay â€” steel mills had closed , and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities .
and so there was also this sense of loss and disappointment .
another is about an elderly couple â€” a white couple in l. a .
and his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over .
it â€™ s more melancholy and reflective .
yes , i think so .
people now remark on this notion of me being very cool , or composed .
and i trace a lot of that back to that process of writing .
i just didn â€™ t have time .
i â€™ m not sure yet .
is it the right word ?
how does it sound aloud ?
so in that sense , i think there will be some consistency .
and so working that very analytical side of the brain all the time sometimes meant you lost track of not just the poetry of fiction , but also the depth of fiction .
are there examples of specific novels or writers ?
i struck up a friendship with [ the novelist ] marilynne robinson , who has become a good friend .
and we â€™ ve become sort of pen pals .
i started reading her in iowa , where â€œ gilead â€ and some of her best novels are set .
it exercises those muscles , and i think that has been helpful .
and then there â€™ s been the occasion where i just want to get out of my own head .
what are some of those books ?
it â€™ s interesting , the stuff i read just to escape ends up being a mix of things â€” some science fiction .
exactly .
the scope of it was immense .
aliens are about to invade .
i loved that structure .
and a similar structure , that i thought was a really powerful novel : â€œ fates and furies , â€ by lauren groff .
which i have to do for this job , too .
like most teenagers in high school , when we were assigned , i don â€™ t know , â€œ the tempest â€ or something , i thought , â€˜ my god , this is boring. â€™ and i took this wonderful shakespeare class in college where i just started to read the tragedies and dig into them .
is that sort of comforting ?
i think toni morrison â€™ s writings â€” particularly â€œ song of solomon â€ is a book i think of when i imagine people going through hardship .
that it â€™ s not just pain , but there â€™ s joy and glory and mystery .
i think that there are writers who i don â€™ t necessarily agree with in terms of their politics , but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things â€” v. s. naipaul , for example .
and yet , there are times where it feels as if that may be true .
lincoln â€™ s own writings do that .
he is a very fine writer .
and there have been times in the evening when i â€™ d just walk over , because it â€™ s right next to my office , my home office , and i just read it .
and perspective is exactly what is wanted .
during very difficult moments , this job can be very isolating .
and i loved reading teddy roosevelt â€™ s writing .
have you read a lot of presidential biographies ?
mcclellan when rebel troops are 20 , 30 , 40 miles away .
i watched some of the documentary â€œ eyes on the prize â€ after the election .
it was useful .
it â€™ s empowering for them .
what books would you recommend at this moment in time , that captures this sense of turmoil ?
i should probably ask you or some people who have had time to catch up on reading .
[ laughter ] they â€™ re ahead of me right now .
and part of what we â€™ re all having to deal with right now is just a lot of information overload and a lack of time to process things .
we â€™ re bombarded with information .
we â€™ re a storytelling species .
but also this combination of â€” that i think is universal â€” longing for this better place , but also feeling displaced and looking backwards at the same time .
i â€™ m no luddite .
but i also love putting my computer in sleep mode and going for a walk with my dog , meeting and chatting with friends , acquaintances and strangers , some of whom have become friends .
instead , we â€™ re constantly bombarded by bells , buzzes and chimes that alert us to messages we feel compelled to view and respond to immediately .
all i could think was â€œ what a waste ! â€ why , you may ask , is it so important to limit our digital lives ?
â€œ we â€™ re wired and tired all the time .
even computers reboot , but we â€™ re not doing it .

it was the latest effort by the united states and its european allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent russia , which condemned the move .
despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum , the arrival of the marines from camp lejeune , n. c. â€” shown on norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow â€” also provoked some jitters in norway .

reading michael eric dyson â€™ s â€œ tears we can not stop : a sermon to white america , â€ i was often reminded of that morning , when i was first exposed to the righteous anger , wry humor and unflinching honesty of a black pastor , determined to guide and teach his flock .
and so rather than a treatise , â€œ tears we can not stop â€ is a fiery sermon , and an unabashedly emotional , personal appeal .
this is a book that will anger some readers , especially those who reject dyson â€™ s central premise : that if we want true racial equality in america , whites themselves must destroy the enduring myths of white supremacy .
â€ dyson is all too familiar with the claims of innocence and the kneejerk defensiveness that will surely greet this book , and yet he sets out to conquer such denial not only with the difficult truth but also , astonishingly , with love .
it is time to let it go , to let it die in the place of the black bodies it wills into nonbeing .
â€ many white readers may wince , as i did , to hear their own indifference to black suffering named with such precision , and some , desperate not to face their involvement in america â€™ s systems of racial oppression , might abandon this book altogether .
he wants readers to wake from their sleep of ignorance about â€œ what it means to be black in america .
but this is a small quibble with a deeply serious , urgent book , which should take its place in the tradition of baldwin â€™ s â€œ the fire next time â€ and king â€™ s â€œ why we can â€™ t wait .

â€ with those words late in a major speech on tuesday , prime minister theresa may charted britain â€™ s course toward a clean break with the european union and expressed her fondest hope : that the time for â€œ division and discord â€ is over .
â€œ the united kingdom is leaving the european union , and my job is to get the right deal for britain as we do , â€ she said .
she confirmed that britain is determined to regain control of migration from the european union and rejected the supremacy of the european court of justice .
â€œ let me be clear , â€ mrs. may said , acknowledging the differences .
â€ she said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the european union by march 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of parliament .
mrs. may struck a diplomatic note , including an appeal for a new partnership with continental europe , but not at all costs .
â€œ not partial membership of the european union , associate membership of the european union , or anything that leaves us half in , half out .
they didn â€™ t .

it rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech , while stocks on the london exchange fell .
charles brasted , a partner at hogan lovells , an international law firm , cautioned that the deal mrs. may wanted was likely to be seen by the european union as â€œ precisely the cherry picking that they have warned against .
â€ he added : â€œ the objectives are now clear .
â€ germany â€™ s foreign minister , steinmeier , welcomed mrs. may â€™ s â€œ desire for a positive and constructive partnership , a friendship with a strong e. u. , â€ which germany would reciprocate .
mrs. may â€™ s speech , delivered in the grand surroundings of lancaster house in london , was the most closely watched statement on european policy since january 2013 , when the prime minister at the time , david cameron , promised to hold a referendum on european union membership .
membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual deals with nations .
in other words , britain would reject what it disliked about the bloc , like freedom of movement , but keep trade unencumbered as it tried to get the best possible trading deal consistent with its other objectives .
â€œ this follows from the u. k. raising some modest barriers to migration from the e. u .
â€ many european union countries have backed taking a hard line against britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving .
anticipating that , mrs. may said that britain wanted a successful european union and a friendly partnership , but that â€œ no deal for britain is better than a bad deal for britain .

britain â€™ s vote in june to leave the bloc struck a stinging blow against regional unity at a time when confidence was already flagging in the european union .
at the time , polling indicated that a slim majority of its population was in favor of membership , hopeful that it would strengthen the balkan country â€™ s economy and political institutions .
still , incomes have risen sharply , billions have been poured into infrastructure and surveys show bulgarians are still convinced that joining was a step in the right direction .
even more bulgarians work and travel throughout the bloc , taking advantage of the region â€™ s free movement of labor .
about 49 percent of bulgarians say they trust the e. u. compared with 33 percent who do not , according to a 2016 survey by eurobarometer , which carries out polling in the region .
that is the level of trust of any member state ( behind lithuania and malta ) and around twice as much trust as bulgarians have in their own government , public institutions or legal system .
as confidence flagged , a fifth of k. t. b .
â€™ s assets were pulled within a week , and the bank was taken into central bank supervision .
the european commission , the bloc â€™ s executive arm , and the european banking authority , a regional financial watchdog , repeatedly called on sofia to fulfill a government guarantee on depositors â€™ savings .
both opened investigations into whether bulgarian authorities had breached regional law by delaying payouts .
in recent years , several major manufacturers of vehicle components â€” with clients including volkswagen , daimler , mercedes and renault â€” have set up shop in bulgaria .
a small community is also being built , and two funds have invested more than â‚¬20 million in around 200 companies over the last four years , thanks to a european initiative .
â€œ if it weren â€™ t for e. u. directives and rules , bulgarian politicians would be untouchable .

mr. trump â€™ s comments over the weekend about the dollar being too strong , about the possibility that more countries will follow britain out of the european union and his intention to tax german carmakers for not building factories in the united states all heightened these concerns .

before being fatally shot by the police , mr. mateen , a security guard , declared his allegiance to the islamic state .
she was also charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly misleading police officers and federal agents , who interviewed her for 12 hours on the day of the shooting .
ms. salman went with her husband to buy ammunition , drove him to orlando when he apparently scouted his target , and knew that he watched jihadist propaganda videos .

powering this farming drive is a thriving market for organic food that amounted to nearly â‚¬7 billion in france in 2016 , according to agence bio , which tracks the trade in the country .
the duke of sully , a minister of king henri iv of france in the early 17th century , once described â€œ plow and pasture â€ as the lifeblood of the french economy , and farming has long been romanticized in a country that values gastronomic treasures like camembert cheeses and bordeaux wines .
that dire outlook , however , has not deterred people like ms. lavarde from taking up farming , even if established farmers view their efforts with skepticism .

even before the end of life option act became law , in october 2015 , she had recorded a video expressing her desire to hasten her death .
last june , legislation took effect in california , the most populous state .
in november , colorado voters approved a ballot measure by nearly a majority .
the district of columbia council has passed a similar law , and the mayor quietly signed it last month .
aid in dying was already legal in washington , vermont , montana and oregon .
historically , aid in dying has generated fierce resistance from the catholic church , from certain activists , and from others who cite religious or moral objections .
even the terminology â€” aid in dying ?
assisted suicide ?
death with dignity ?
â€œ now , we have proof on the ground that that is not true .
whites represent a minority of californians .
in the district of columbia , nearly half of whose residents are five of six black council members voted in favor of the legislation .
the california medical association , the colorado medical society and the medical society of the district of columbia all took officially neutral stances as legislators and voters debated , depriving opponents of influential allies .
sometimes , when patients have waited until late in their illnesses , they die before they can become eligible for assisted death .
or they become too physically or mentally incapacitated to take the drugs themselves , as legally required , even if they do qualify .
and costs can also prove a barrier .
states like california and oregon have agreed to cover the costs for medicaid recipients others do not .
but in 2015 , as california legislators introduced their bill , valeant pharmaceuticals acquired seconal , the most commonly used drug .
despite such obstacles and disappointments , an emboldened compassion and choices , with a staff that has tripled since 2008 and an annual budget that has nearly quadrupled to $ 16 .
9 million â€” is eyeing its next targets .
aid in dying , it should be noted , may be a vehemently debated issue , with campaigns that can involve thousands of participants and millions of dollars â€” but it ultimately has affected a tiny proportion of people .
yet the end of life care most people receive needs substantial improvement .

dr. rabow did not want to see her die , and he is no fan of the movement .

411,17750 , pendant found in nazi death camp ruins may have anne frank link - the new york times , new york times , dan bilefsky,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0 , , '' sometime in september 1943 , karoline cohn undressed and waited for her hair to be shaved at a hut at sobibor , the nazi extermination camp , in eastern poland .
then , as karoline , 14 , walked the final steps to the gas chambers , most likely unaware that she was about to be killed , she dropped a pendant engraved with the words â€œ good luck â€ in hebrew through the wooden floorboards .
tantalizingly , the pendant â€” and karoline â€” may also have a link to anne frank , the young diarist who has become a powerful symbol of the holocaust .
â€œ there , along the path to the gas chambers of sobibor , the pendant belonging to karoline cohn was taken , dropped and remained buried in the ground for over 70 years , â€ said joel zisenwine , director of the deportations database project at the yad vashem holocaust memorial , which announced the discovery last weekend .
the discovery offered clues but also raised several questions : was karoline a close friend or relative of frank â€™ s ?
or was it a relative , perhaps her mother , who had clung to it after karoline was killed ?

mr. remnick is also , among other things , a critic .
he â€™ s more than equipped to sum her up .
but he outsourced that job .
mr. obama , for nearly all of his tenure , was fully aware of , interested in , and knowledgeable about popular culture , even as it grew impossible to take it all in .
he tried : sports , movies , television , the internet , music , books .
he was protean and catholic .
lots of smart people are poring over mr. obama â€™ s record to divine a legacy .
which policies will last ?
how did he distinguish himself ?
in other words , mr. obama â€™ s place in popular culture has always felt new , alive and mostly underappreciated .
television was in its creative infancy when dwight d. eisenhower entered office in 1953 , and he took quick advantage of the power of its immediacy .
but it was tragedy and a glamorous wife that ensured kennedy â€™ s legacy in popular culture .
richard nixon disliked â€œ all in the family â€ and was an avid moviegoer , who according to mark feeney â€™ s surprising book â€œ nixon at the movies , â€ watched about 500 films during his presidency .
lunches with the novelists zadie smith , barbara kingsolver , junot dÃ­az , dave eggers and colson whitehead .
when he entered office , in 2009 , netflix was a service .
now it â€™ s a major reason we no longer watch tv we scarf it down .
he presided over an era in which television and movies grappled with the meaning and meaninglessness of race , whether to laugh at it or take it seriously or ignore it altogether , whether the idea of a postracial america was ever possible , as though electing a black man for eight years erases the traumas of 400 .
to that end , â€œ 30 rock â€ was the great situation comedy â€” a workplace farce , on and loosely about nbc , that hit its stride in 2008 and ran until 2013 .
the protagonists are car thieves turned action heroes , who are mostly black , asian , latina or racially ambiguous .
these aren â€™ t great movies .
and they take an issue that hollywood has always struggled with â€” what to do with all these talented , interesting people of color ?
â€” and laughs at it .
what to do ?
it â€™ s not that hard : let â€™ em drive .
but mr. obama has always seemed to understand the importance of culture as mirror , window , escape hatch and haven .
the honor went to 21 men and women , from robert de niro and tom hanks and michael jordan to cicely tyson and diana ross and ellen degeneres .
so were maya lin and robert redford .
and , as he so often does and gets nary enough credit for , he delivered it with perfectly timed drollery .
these people meant something to him .
the knock on mr. obama was that he was dry and aloof .
perhaps but not always .
he knew the power of songs .
in 2015 , at the memorial service after the charleston massacre , he takes a dramatic , deliberative pause before intoning the lyrics to â€œ amazing grace .
they wait until the office is behind him , for the right mix of distance and scholarship .
â€ the man knows his country and his ray .

at his kitchen table that night in september , mr. harris wondered : who might have found these fraudulent clinton ballots ?
so he invented â€œ randall prince , a electrical worker .

it was a photo from the birmingham mail , showing a british election 3 , 700 miles from columbus â€” but no matter .
prince , shown here , poses with his find , as election officials investigate .
â€ the article explained that â€œ the clinton campaign â€™ s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on november 8th .
â€ then mr. harris added a touch of breathlessness .
he was correct .
it was eventually shared with six million people , according to crowdtangle , which tracks web audiences .
there was nothing especially christian about his efforts , mr. harris admits he had simply bought the abandoned web address for $ 5 at expireddomains .

he had graduated from davidson college in north carolina in may , and he needed to pay his living expenses .
he had done better with â€œ early morning explosion in dc allegedly leaves yet another dnc staffer dead , â€ spinning off conspiracy theories around the earlier shooting death of a democratic national committee staff member .
it was almost like a sociological experiment , â€ added mr. harris , who majored in political science and economics .
he checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless .

â€ she added , â€œ to put them on the same stage as this man , to me , is reprehensible .
several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly , the madison square garden company would take legal action against them .
a radio city rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique , a rare , regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry .
they must hit positions with military exactitude .
it â€™ s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line â€” not to take over and not to be left behind .
it takes fortitude and humility .
â€œ things down to your pinkie finger .
â€ under the leadership of linda haberman , who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the â€œ christmas spectacular â€ in 1993 , the rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography .
ms. haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment .
â€œ whether or not that causes a rift throughout the brand is yet to be seen .
â€œ i â€™ ve also heard the women of color are very upset .

â€œ when i stand in front of the council , it won â€™ t be my ideas i â€™ ll be expounding on , it â€™ ll be the ideas of the majority in parliament , â€ he added , apparently referring to summit meetings of the european council .
by the fourth and final round of balloting on tuesday night , mr. tajani won 351 votes in a runoff against mr. pittella , who took 282 votes .
mr. verhofstadt suggested that he was taking the step to ensure that the parliament did not end up weakened by small but staunchly parties .
the hottest issue in european union affairs is how tough to be over britain â€™ s exit , and the parliament has a veto on any deal london reaches with the rest of the bloc .
that will be tested when the parliament votes in on whether to approve the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the european union and canada .
mr. tajani will also need to oversee passage of highly contentious legislation that could oblige european union member states to share the burden of hosting asylum seekers under emergency conditions .
the parliament has also become a magnet for lobbyists seeking to influence legislation on issues from the amount of permissible emissions from industry , including cars , to the way cellphone calls are priced .
south koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of mr. lee .
the special prosecutor called the court decision â€œ very regrettable .
he can also indict mr. lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him .
â€œ we will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering , â€ said lee a spokesman for the special prosecutor , without elaborating .
samsung welcomed the court â€™ s decision .
it dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against mr. lee and ms. park .
mr. lee , 48 , was accused of paying $ 36 million to ms. park â€™ s secretive confidante , choi .
the special prosecutor and mr. lee â€™ s lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money .
but the special prosecutor , park who took over the investigation from state prosecutors last month , has called samsung â€™ s contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from ms. park .
ms. park denies any wrongdoing .
mr. lee and samsung have also denied bribery they argued that the â€œ donations â€ samsung paid out to ms. choi were coerced , not meant as a quid pro quo for political favors from ms .
park . ''
â€œ jawohl ! â€ a few shouted .
he added that germans had the â€œ mentality of a totally vanquished people .
baiting the helpless to promote yourself is weakness .
the party is polling at nearly 15 percent , ahead of some mainstream parties , for this fall â€™ s national election .
but that risks letting those fringes define its contours .
mr. hÃ¶cke called mr. weizsacker â€™ s address â€œ a speech against his own people , and not for his own people .
â€ since 2015 , when germany received nearly a million asylum seekers , alternative for germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism .
establishment parties and other enemies , mr. hÃ¶cke told the crowd , â€œ are liquidating our beloved german fatherland , like a piece of soap under warm running water .
â€ mr. hÃ¶cke concluded his speech on tuesday with a rallying call .

in 2015 and 2016 , the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as el niÃ±o , in which the pacific ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere .
but arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat .
drought and starvation afflicted africa .
8 degrees fahrenheit .
even at current temperatures , billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean .
the sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions .
those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace , and coastal communities in the united states are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding .
that group , however , did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis , 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014 .
those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring emissions under control .
he agrees , to a point .
â€œ i wanted it for closure .
â€ mr. schrager applied in 2012 for the pardon , which restores civil liberties like voting but does not expunge a criminal record , and he waited each year for a decision , with no word back .

â€ â€œ some of it you can â€™ t recoup , â€ he added .
â€œ i â€™ ll always have the scar .
but the lasting effect after more than three decades is mostly emotional , an abiding sense of shame .
his son overheard the ensuing excited conversation between mr. schrager and his wife , tania wahlstedt .

i always trusted her with it .
ms. manigo met her biological parents on saturday , at a teary reunion followed by a trip to the mall .
she called them mom and dad , because she figured those were words they had been waiting a long time to hear .
â€œ they don â€™ t feel like .
they feel like distant family .
her father , craig aiken , told in jacksonville the meeting was â€œ beautiful .
she needs identification and a social security card .
when she was a preschooler living with her mother , her father took her , and it was not until she was a teenager and saw her picture on a milk carton that she realized that she had been abducted .
ms .
waters eventually reconnected with her mother , distanced herself from her father and , as an adult , befriended other survivors of abduction .
waters , now 46 , married and a mother herself , living on long island .
who is wrong and who â€™ s right ?
who really loves me ?
â€œ as you connect the dots over a period of time , it â€™ s a pretty normal reaction to become upset with the abductor , and a child who was abducted may have trouble developing intimacy and trust with other people , â€ he said .
â€œ we often see a degree of anger at the parents who were left behind , even if that â€™ s not really justified , like â€˜ why didn â€™ t you look harder for me ?
â€™ â€ but cases like ms. mobley â€™ s are quite rare .
and abduction by a stranger often has a tragic end â€” sexual abuse , death or both .
â€œ like most hospitals , we currently have specialized , security measures in place , both and electronic , to protect newborns and their mothers .
â€œ i like that .

mr. mccartney â€™ s suit is over what is known as copyright termination : the right of authors â€” or any creators â€” to reclaim ownership of their works from publishers after a specific length of time has passed .
in mr. mccartney â€™ s suit , filed in united states district court in manhattan , lawyers for the singer detailed the steps they have taken over the last nine years to reclaim mr. mccartney â€™ s piece of the copyrights in dozens of beatles songs he wrote with john lennon , including â€œ love me do , â€ â€œ i want to hold your hand â€ and â€œ all you need is love .
â€ that process involved filing numerous legal notices , which , the suit says , should be enough to guarantee that would return the rights to mr. mccartney , starting in october 2018 .
as mr. mccartney â€™ s suit notes , he and mr. lennon signed a series of publishing contracts in britain beginning in 1962 .
michael jackson purchased the rights to those songs in 1985 , and 10 years later he formed as a joint venture with sony .

454,17797 , ex-chief of vw holds firm during grilling on emissions deception - the new york times , new york times , alison smale and jack ewing,2017-01-19,2017.0,1.0 , , '' berlin â€” volkswagen â€™ s former chief executive , martin winterkorn , yielded no ground on thursday during a polite grilling by german lawmakers over the carmaker â€™ s deception , but he astonished them by insisting that he had not heard the term â€œ defeat device â€ before september 2015 , when the scandal broke .
but his assertions are increasingly difficult to defend after volkswagen pleaded guilty in the united states last week to criminal charges that included conspiracy to defraud the government , violations of the clean air act and obstruction of justice .
the company is paying $ 20 billion to resolve civil and criminal charges related to the scandal .
mr. winterkorn , who has not been charged , was chief executive throughout the decade when , as volkswagen now admits , employees devised software , known as a â€œ defeat device , â€ that could hide excess pollutants during testing by regulators .
but in his comments on thursday , mr. winterkorn reiterated that he had not known of the efforts to evade emissions rules .
â€œ the unthinkable has happened and we must all deal with it .
the lawsuits seek billions of dollars in damages .
the settlement calls for the carmaker to pay $ 4 .
3 billion in civil and criminal penalties to the american government .
in 90 minutes of questioning on thursday , mr. winterkorn provided details on a variety of issues related to volkswagen â€™ s business , but he was vague when asked about the emissions scandal and whom he had informed about it .
in part , he was doing the german equivalent of invoking the fifth amendment in the united states , citing an investigation by state prosecutors in braunschweig , a city close to the carmaker â€™ s headquarters in wolfsburg .
but the former chief executive also repeatedly replied , â€œ i am not aware , â€ or â€œ i don â€™ t know , â€ when asked about conversations with chancellor angela merkel of germany and ferdinand piÃ«ch , the chairman of volkswagen â€™ s supervisory board until late april 2015 .
mr. gottweis , a volkswagen executive who specialized in solving technical emergencies around the world , warned in a memo in may 2014 that american regulators were likely to investigate â€œ whether volkswagen implemented a test detection system in the engine control unit software ( defeat device ) .

at least 30 people were missing , according to the authorities .
mr. parete told him that the hotel had been wiped out : â€œ the hotel isn â€™ t here anymore , it â€™ s not here , â€ mr. marcella told the newspaper .
â€œ i insisted , â€ mr. marcella told corriere della sera .
the last time fulvio vagnarelli heard from his brother marco , who was staying at the hotel with his girlfriend paola tomassini , it was via a social media message late on wednesday afternoon .
officials registered more than 100 aftershocks on thursday .
francesco provolo , the prefect of pescara , the province that includes farindola , told rai that rescuers had to travel more than five miles on skis and snowshoes to reach the hotel , as billowing snow continued to fall throughout the night .
a spokesman for the civil protection department in pescara estimated that up to 30 people were in the hotel at the time of the avalanche .
the hotel has 43 rooms , but it was not clear how many guests were staying there at the time of the avalanche .

bombs isis camps in libya - the new york times , new york times , eric schmitt and michael r. gordon,2017-01-20,2017.0,1.0 , , '' washington â€” two united states air force bombers attacked islamic state training camps in libya overnight , killing more than 80 militants , including some who were involved in plotting terrorist attacks in europe , the pentagon said on thursday .
â€œ we need to strike isil everywhere they show up , â€ ashton b. carter , the departing defense secretary , told reporters .
â€œ we know that some of the isil operatives in libya were involved in plotting attacks in europe .
on monday , mr. obama approved airstrikes against the camps .
after the dropped their bombs , the reaper drones followed up with their strikes .
jonathan winer , the obama administration â€™ s special envoy to libya , told congress in november that the islamic state , as it suffered defeats in surt , was most likely forming cells elsewhere in the country .
he called on libyans to unite behind the country â€™ s fledgling government of national accord to combat the terrorists .
several firefighters burst into tears .
â€œ my friends are in there .
army conscripts were deployed to clear paths for the emergency vehicles .
the bullet sped toward carlos vasquez , who ran just steps ahead of the gunman .
but it missed its mark , just outside the melrose houses in the south bronx , and kept whistling through the air .
the bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped .
then , with the last of its fading energy , it tore into ms. cavero .
alejandro almonte , 45 , a heard ms. cavero yelp and saw her fall .
he ran to where she lay , facedown , on the blacktop by a small car â€™ s bumper .
she was dying , the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12:50 p. m. on nov. 2 , a sunny wednesday .
the slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a jeep parked near a house at 426 east 154th street .
michael j. lopuzzo , the commander of the 40th precinct detective squad , looked uphill , where the bullet had been fired , and downhill , where it had come to rest , and surveyed the maze of telephone poles , streetlights , wires , cars and trees in between .
â€œ a light pole ?
a sign ? â€ it was grim news for detectives in the 40th precinct , where the new york times has been examining every homicide logged in 2016 , a succession of assassinations , gang killings , domestic murders and random slayings .
now , less than a mile away and five months later , the police had another mystery and another blameless bystander lying crumpled on the ground .
detectives were initially unable to explain what had happened .
the mayor â€™ s office called the chief of detectives , and the chief of detectives called sergeant lopuzzo .
the message was simple : do all you can .
the department flooded the streets with rookies who picked through trash and shined flashlights in alleyways and sewer grates searching for any potential evidence .
detectives checked ms. cavero â€™ s background for clues .
it was a striking show of force , and a marked escalation from the police response after ms. white was killed as she tried to shield her children from gunfire .
â€œ it was just a matter of time .
â€œ where you can read all the steps in the investigation , and what they saw and what they found and what the video shows and what the evidence shows .
â€œ â€˜ i â€™ ll do it .
she enjoyed certain solitary pursuits , like romance novels and the online game farmville .
but they often ended near midnight .
â€œ sometimes gunfights are heard outside .
â€œ i don â€™ t understand .
â€ for the investigation into ms. cavero â€™ s killing , finding the small , smooth slug under a jeep near the body was the case â€™ s first big break .
he heard a gunshot and the tinkle of a brass shell hitting the sidewalk as the gunman turned back and sprinted into the melrose houses .
on the street , besides the shell casing , detectives discovered an object they believed had also fallen from the gunman â€™ s hands : a silver cigarette lighter .
television satellite trucks began showing up , a rare but welcome sight for investigators in this part of the city , who hoped publicity might encourage witnesses to come forward .
for sergeant lopuzzo , a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes does nothing to blunt his frustration over witnesses who will not speak .
mr. vasquez had been arrested more than a dozen times and had been convicted of drug dealing and illegal possession of a knife .
he sold in the melrose houses near the corner of east 153rd street and courtlandt avenue , where his mother lived , according to court records and the police .
he ran .
â€œ i ducked between cars .
â€ the case detective , ivan monge , also knew the gunman when he saw the video .
he had arrested mr. oquendo â€™ s older sister on assault charges in october .
detectives did not recover the gun .
â€œ and she wanted the proof .
â€ detective rodriguez went to her home and took her to the squad room , where he showed her a wanted flier with an image of her son taken from the videos .
finally she broke down .
steven mechanic , a veteran public defender who had represented mr. oquendo against several criminal charges in the past , surrendered him to the police .
â€œ there are no winners in this case , â€ mr .
his parents cried .
â€œ i know the mother â€™ s side of the family personally .
he comes from a good family , but everyone takes their own path in life .
she nodded toward the streets outside her window and spoke of her son â€™ s sorrow for ms. cavero â€™ s death .
â€œ if he did do it , it was not intentional .
â€ she felt a kinship for ms. cavero â€™ s family .
mr. oquendo , the fourth of her six children , was troubled and , from a young age , attended a special school for emotionally disturbed children .
â€ twice , her son was accused of crimes involving guns , according to court documents and law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential records .
he was indicted on a gun possession charge in that case , which was transferred to family court and sealed .
then , in august 2015 , he was arrested when a police officer saw him drop a .
her son had been coaching young basketball players at the local classic community center , on the courts where chris mccullough of the brooklyn nets once reigned .
â€œ but once you pull that trigger , you can â€™ t pull that back .
in october , he had a dispute with mr. vasquez outside a local barbershop .
after speaking with detective rodriguez , mr. oquendo â€™ s mother reached her son and asked him to surrender .
â€œ i don â€™ t want my son out on the run .
â€ now , he is in a rikers island jail cell , facing a indictment on murder and other charges .
he turned 18 there and spent thanksgiving and christmas alone .
â€ ms. cavero â€™ s relatives , who are tracking the suspect â€™ s court appearances , are afraid of just that : a light sentence .
dna tests on the silver lighter recovered near the shell casing were inconclusive .
she thought back to the moment the police informed her of her daughter â€™ s killing .
it is a question the police can not answer .

but i won â€™ t do them , at least not in this life .
â€ another thing that kept ms. peters singing was her impeccable technique : from the age of 13 , she had trained for an operatic career as an athlete trains for the olympics .
by the time she was 19 and auditioned for the met , she knew the scores of 20 operas cold .
roberta peterman , an only child , was born on may 4 , 1930 , and grew up near jerome avenue and 170th street in the bronx .

leaving school permanently after she completed junior high , roberta took six lessons a week from mr. herman on a scholarship .
he also arranged for supplementary instruction in french , italian , german , dance and drama .

somewhere out in the darkness was mr. bing .
but on nov. 17 , the soprano nadine conner , scheduled to sing zerlina in a met â€œ don giovanni â€ that night , fell ill. at 3 p. m. mr. bing telephoned ms. peters and told her to report to the opera house in time for an 8 o â€™ clock curtain .

461,17804 , '' most primate species threatened with extinction , scientists find - the new york times '' , new york times , carl zimmer,2017-01-23,2017.0,1.0 , , '' our fellow primates are in trouble .
from gorillas to gibbons , primates are in significantly worse shape now than in recent decades because of the devastation from agriculture , hunting and mining .
â€œ it â€™ s alarming without being alarmist .
â€ but most species are not so flexible .
other species that are critically endangered include the spider monkey of ecuador , the niger delta red colobus , and the crested macaque , an indonesian species famous for having taken a selfie with a photographer â€™ s camera .
the incentives to kill primates are not only local , though .
â€œ they â€™ re a driving force through the whole region .
in the amazon , the jungle is being converted to cattle ranches and soybean fields , while in madagascar , rice paddies are taking the place of lemur forests .
palm oil can be found in everything from doughnuts to lipstick to biodiesel fuel .
even cellphones can add to the risks .
those miners hunt for their meals .
while western scientists never laid eyes on these remarkable creatures , the fossil record shows that 17 lemur species became extinct after humans arrived there 2 , 000 years ago .
more recently , a monkey called miss waldron â€™ s red colobus has disappeared from its range in west africa .
in china , a subspecies called the gibbon may have gone extinct as well .
some of the most endangered primate species are down to just a few dozen survivors .
in madagascar , for example , humans may have to move deeper into lemur habitats for new farmland .
recent research has shown that primates are extremely important to the ecosystems in which they live .
â€œ but now we know they are .
â€ primates have also been invaluable for understanding ourselves .
the first primates evolved roughly 80 million years ago , and then split into the living lineages over millions of years .
in some cases , it may be possible to take the pressure off primates by building fish farms as an alternate source of protein .
today , the species has a small but stable population of some 3 , 500 individuals in the wild .

â€œ my kids , they love being native , â€ he told me .
st. germain was a teenager when he enrolled in the tribe .
he had dozens of family members who were also nooksack .
the process , he figured , would be so straightforward that his kids would be certified nooksacks in time for christmas , when the tribe gives parents a small stipend for buying gifts : â€œ i thought it was a situation .
at the time , rudy and kelly were friends , allies on the council .
but the debate over whether rudy â€™ s family qualified as nooksack tore them apart .
rudy and his extended family refer to kelly as a monster and a dictator he calls them pond scum and con artists .
they agree on almost nothing , but both remember the day when things fell apart the same way .
â€ to rudy , the words were an expression of shock .
at stake were not just his family â€™ s jobs and homes and treaty rights but also who they were and where they belonged .
â€œ i â€™ ll be labeled a .
so yeah , i take this very personally .
â€ to kelly , the words were an admission of guilt , implicating not just the st. germains but also hundreds of tribal members to whom they were related .
â€œ i â€™ m in a war , â€ he told me later , sketching family trees on the back of a copy of the tribe â€™ s constitution .
â€œ this is our culture , not a game .
there were some records and even some living memories of the ancestors whose nooksack heritage was being called into doubt .
in january 2013 , kelly announced that , after searching through files at the bureau of indian affairs office in nearby everett , he had reason to doubt the legitimacy of more than 300 enrolled nooksacks related to the st. germains , all of whom claimed to descend from a woman named annie george , born in 1875 .
the resolution passed unanimously .
even harder was watching the effect on his brother , rudy .
â€œ it took the wind right out of him .
word and shock spread quickly through the small , reservation .
the disenrollees , now calling themselves â€œ the nooksack 306 , â€ hired a lawyer and vowed to contest their expulsion .
â€œ and i think we will , before this is over .
before the arrival of white settlers , tribal boundaries were generally fluid intermarriages and alliances were common .
â€ those definitions shifted as the colonial government â€™ s goals did .
â€œ mixed blood â€ indians , for example , were added to rolls in hopes that assimilated indians would be more likely to cede their land later , after land claims were established , more restrictive definitions were adopted .
in 1988 the historian kent carter coined a term for the millions who claim indian ancestry but who , for a variety of reasons , don â€™ t sort neatly into today â€™ s official boxes : people with mixed tribal heritage people whose ancestors were denied recognition by early government agents or died before registration was complete people whose tribes , in the face of the federal government â€™ s attempts to extinguish them , didn â€™ t maintain the cohesion that same government would later require for recognition .
carter called them the â€œ outalucks .
tribes have on occasion been warned that federal recognition , and thus their rights , can disappear if their membership becomes unclear .
others regarded it as odd , even offensive .
an ojibwe man joked that he is also â€œ part white , but i don â€™ t have the papers to prove it .
â€ a woman replied , â€œ i don â€™ t like being talked about in a vocabulary usually reserved for dogs and horses .
even the dead have been disenrolled and , in some cases , exhumed from their graves , against tradition and taboo , to have their dna tested .

the family spoke halkomelem , a native language that was widely spoken in what is now british columbia but also in the nooksack river valley until the century it eventually largely replaced the original nooksack language , lhechalosem .

before long , the descendants of annie george became an influential voting bloc , and their members were being elected to council seats and hired to run tribal offices .
while some elders welcomed them , others were skeptical .
some elders had no memory of them others remembered them visiting but thought of them as shxway .
kelly heard , indirectly , that elders in british columbia didn â€™ t remember the sisters â€™ being born there , but rather , showing up suddenly as young children â€” the beginning of his suspicions that , though they â€œ had teachings , â€ the sisters weren â€™ t annie â€™ s real daughters at all but children she had taken in .
in 2000 , after a number of rabangs were arrested for smuggling marijuana into the united states from canada , some elders told the associated press that â€œ a clan of outsiders masquerading as nooksacks â€ was â€œ controlling tribal government .
â€ bob kelly now calls and the other first enrollees from her extended family â€œ trojan horses .
for centuries , the people fished their own river valley but also traveled regularly , including to what is now canada â€™ s fraser river , to fish for salmon or gather shellfish .
most refused .
of those who remained , some filed homestead claims on their own lands others scattered in search of a livelihood .
he was referring to the general allotment act , under which tribally owned land was carved into small parcels and handed out to individuals .
it was a huge blow to the stability and sovereignty of tribes : within 20 years , native people lost ownership of 90 million acres .
it was also the beginning of the government â€™ s reliance on blood quantum to determine indian status .
their direct descendants could also be enrolled , provided they had â€œ at least ( ) degree indian blood .
k. to be indian .
â€ in a 2015 tweet , sherman alexie , the spokane and coeur d â€™ alene author , put it even more emphatically : â€œ dear indian tribes who disenroll members , you should be ashamed of your colonial and capitalistic bullshit .
they had no birth certificate for annie , so they turned to old censuses and to church records kept by the archdiocese of vancouver , marking the sacraments of birth , marriage and death .
indian censuses taken during annie â€™ s childhood repeatedly recorded her living with george and madeline .
â€ the 306 think this is compelling evidence madeline adopted annie .
â€ records indicate that matsqui was considered a nooksack village even after the canadian border was established to the south , and matsqui george was a chief of the village .
in a u. s. census from 1910 , louis george indicated that both his parents , madeline and matsqui george , were nooksacks from washington , and that he was a nooksack .
â€œ if you don â€™ t have documentation , then you â€™ re not indian .
they married other nooksacks and had kids those kids had kids .
( their competing slogans were â€œ we belong â€ and â€œ we are nooksack .
kelly began insisting that meetings be held over the phone .
i muted a lot of people .
â€ by that time , kelly was calling the 306 scam artists .
â€œ nobody stepped forward and claimed them ! â€ he told me repeatedly .
â€œ you don â€™ t show up and just insert yourself into someone else â€™ s family tree .
the charge was treason .
to avoid the tribal police , they met on the grounds of an old logging show .
he shrugged .
â€œ it â€™ s not real .
it â€™ s .
â€ people rose to speak .
he described the scenario : for lots of people to be cut off from the tribal community , â€œ to be just a person roaming around , trying to figure it out for themselves .
â€œ oh !
you are standing !
â€œ but i know now .
they named their canoes â€” with seating for 15 â€” for annie â€™ s daughters , and shared them with people of the shxway band .
â€ the following month , the 306 celebrated what they saw as a hopeful precedent when the grand ronde tribal court of appeals overturned the disenrollment of chief tumulth â€™ s descendants , holding that it was unfair to subject tribal members to â€œ such an extreme sanction â€ after accepting them for nearly three decades .
elsewhere , a few tribes have rejected disenrollment altogether .
the federated indians of graton rancheria in california amended their constitution to ban disenrollment in 2013 .
but the nooksack dispute dragged on .
in october , the bureau of indian affairs informed kelly that it would not recognize any actions of the tribal council because it failed to hold elections in march 2016 , stressing that it wasn â€™ t telling the tribe who counted as a member but simply responding to the â€œ exceedingly rare situation â€ of a council â€™ s lacking a quorum .
so when the 306 received letters informing them that their disenrollment hearings had finally been scheduled to take place on the phone in november , they weren â€™ t sure what to do .
michelle roberts called from canada , where she was staying with shxway friends .
â€œ we are all nooksack .
i am nooksack .
you are not my relative through madeline .
â€œ that â€™ s not mine .
â€ a week later , the day before thanksgiving , kelly announced that the tribe had removed the names of â€œ who had been erroneously enrolled in the tribe â€ from its membership list .
those who called and those who didn â€™ t , all were gone .
but of course it wasn â€™ t over .
in late december , the bureau of indian affairs warned that the tribe â€™ s failure to hold valid elections put all its federal funding at risk .
yet there jennifer guyton and tyler coverdale were , standing in a sea of orange sand and brittle yellow grass with their carp pole .
and it has received mixed reviews from scientists entrenched in the dispute .
dr. tarnita worked with juan bonachela , a mathematician from the university of strathclyde in scotland , to test the termite and plant explanations in a computer model .
but when they tested both mechanisms together , the model revealed a second , smaller pattern hidden within the clumps of grass between the fairy circles .
so they sent ms. guyton and mr. coverdale to namibia in 2015 with their camera and fishing pole .

the footage then cuts to a scene of the dog submerged as people swim toward it .
cut it ! â€ the source of the video , recorded in 2015 , was not immediately clear , but the filmmakers have not disputed its authenticity .
the identity of the man in the video was also not immediately revealed .
while we are all disheartened by the appearance of an animal in distress , everyone has assured us that hercules the german shepherd was not harmed throughout the filmmaking .
several people involved in the film condemned the actions seen in the video .
â€œ i have been a lifelong animal lover , and â€˜ a dog â€™ s purpose â€™ is my third film about dogs .
the employee was later placed on administrative leave , and the organization was â€œ bringing in an independent third party to conduct an investigation , â€ according to the statement .
â€œ when the dog showed signs of resistance to jumping in the water , the scene should have been stopped , â€ mr. stubis said .

it is the central question i have struggled with over the past 10 months .
why couldn â€™ t we stay in his life ?

the show has a mission : to give audiences a fresh take on dickinson .
it â€™ s a portrait of dickinson at around age 10 with her older brother , austin , and young sister , lavinia , done by a local artist , otis allen .
it â€™ s sort of a big deal to have it here : this is the first time it has left houghton library at harvard since it arrived there in 1950 .
in a sweet coincidence , the roses on the paper echo the flower the holds in her portrait .
it â€™ s another rare visitant â€” it last left home at amherst college in 1986 â€” and it â€™ s almost a shock to see how small it is : like a holy card or a talisman .
it had its stresses .
i think it wasn â€™ t easy .
her school friends had dispersed .
several had married .
among them was susan gilbert , with whom she had forged a tight emotional and intellectual bond , and whom she relied on as a first reader and editor of her poetry .
by 1858 , dickinson had accumulated enough poems to begin collecting them in handwritten , booklets known as fascicles .
in the show , it â€™ s placed side by side with the earlier , authenticated photograph .
much of dickinson â€™ s poetry from this time has an experimental , incendiary flair images of combat and violence occur .
oddly , in the midst of the conflict , war was rarely her active theme .
whitman was permanently shaped by the war and its waste .
whether dickinson was , i don â€™ t know .
she began to withdraw .
the primary relics from this time forward are her manuscripts of poems .
nearly 1 , 800 survive 24 examples are in the show , organized by mike kelly , head of archives and special collections at amherst college , and carolyn vega , assistant curator in the morgan â€™ s department of literary and historical manuscripts .
dickinson â€™ s penmanship grew eccentric over time , as did her compositional methods .
â€” shaped like a house .
in the show â€™ s catalog , aptly titled â€œ the networked recluse : the connected world of emily dickinson , â€ the art historian marta werner analyzes the visual nature of the manuscripts .
yet what matters most in dickinson is the element most easily passed over in an exhibition : words .
she was an outsider , and as such a disrupter .
was she a feminist ?
that â€™ s a revolutionary talking .
and her voice carries , subaudibly explosive , through this show . ''
â€œ america will start winning again , winning like never before .
we will bring back our jobs .
we will bring back our wealth .

sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine , while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas .
more than 200 people were arrested .
democrats were not impressed .
but they , too , planned to return , at least part time , to washington , where mrs. biden teaches at a community college in the virginia suburbs .
but mr. trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency .
mr. pence , 57 , was sworn in at 11:54 a. m. placing his hand on ronald reagan â€™ s bible , which was held by his wife , karen , as their three adult children , michael , charlotte and audrey , watched .
also there was barron , his son with the first lady .
it was not a conventionally republican speech , with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government .
instead , he laid out a protectionist agenda , saying his rule will be â€œ buy american and hire american .
â€ he did pledge to â€œ eradicate from the face of the earth â€ islamic terrorism .
â€ he added , â€œ that all changes starting right here and right now .

gone are the days , he said , when america extended its defensive umbrella without compensation , or spent billions to try to lift the fortune of foreign nations , with no strategic benefits for the united states .

mr. keith isn â€™ t as uncomplicated a choice as he might appear from a distance .
mr. keith â€™ s career soared after when his music took an aggressive turn .
at this show , he played the pugnacious and proud â€œ courtesy of the red , white and blue ( the angry american ) , â€ and also â€œ american soldier , â€ a meditative embrace of patriotic dedication .
he also played â€œ beer for my horses , â€ with its endorsement of vigilante justice : â€œ take all the rope in texas , find a tall oak up all them bad boys , hang them high in the all the people to see .
â€ mr. keith â€™ s songs about america are very conscious of place , and at this show , that proved an effective strategy .
the frontmen of country leaned heavily on songs that mentioned bucolic southern settings : â€œ god blessed texas , â€ â€œ amy â€™ s back in austin , â€ â€œ walking in memphis .
this concert ended up being as notable for who did not show up as for who did .
the only featured nonwhite performers were sam moore ( of the 1960s soul duo sam dave ) who sang a restrained â€œ america the beautiful â€ backed by an choir , and dj ravidrums , who delivered his dim , caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical drum kit .

mr. guzmÃ¡n â€™ s arraignment , in federal district court , was both a news media spectacle and a pro forma counterpoint to his sudden extradition from mexico on thursday afternoon , when a police jet flew him from the border to macarthur airport in islip , on long island .
the brief court proceeding took place under tight security , with police vehicles , heavily armed guards and dogs patrolling the grounds outside the courthouse .
at the briefing , robert l. capers , the united states attorney in brooklyn , called the extradition of mr. guzmÃ¡n , whose nickname means shorty , a milestone in the pursuit of a trafficker who achieved mythic status in his homeland as a robin outlaw and a serial prison escapee .
they noted his vast wealth and asserted his propensity for violence and his penchant for escaping mexican prisons â€” most notably , the altiplano prison , where he lived in isolation under surveillance .
the document tracks his progression from the 1980s , as a smuggler who transported colombian cocaine to the united states and returned the profits to traffickers there so efficiently that he earned the nickname el rÃ¡pido , through the â€™ 90s , when he began consolidating his control in mexico .
as colombian traffickers faced increased enforcement of extradition laws , and thus greater threat of prosecution in the united states , they ceded elements of the distribution networks in the united states to mexican cartels , according to the memo .

yet he spent that time in texas prisons , in what an appellate court now calls â€œ a criminal justice nightmare .
the panel dismissed the indictment against mr. hartfield , who is developmentally disabled , in effect erasing the recent conviction .
â€œ we are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free , â€ judge gina m. benavides wrote for the court of appeals .
the killer bashed in her head with a pickax , stole money from the station and took her car , and there was evidence of sexual assault after death .
mr. hartfield , a black man , signed a confession that he later disavowed , and , crucially , investigators said he told them where to find ms. lowe â€™ s car .
a jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death .
after years of legal wrangling , the high court ruling took effect in march 1983 .
under texas law at the time , prosecutors had a way to avoid a retrial and preserve the conviction â€” but only if they acted within a time frame set by the court .
prosecutors have argued that mr. hartfield had legal representation all along , because his original defense team remained his lawyers of record until a court formally dismissed them in 2013 .
finally , in 2013 , texas â€™ court of criminal appeals ruled that mr. hartfield â€™ s conviction and life sentence were void , but his motions were also void .
if that sentence were counted from the start of his time in prison , he would have been eligible for parole long ago .

storytelling was a nightly ritual in the clemens home .
it â€™ s impossible to know why twain did not finish the tale , or if he ever intended it for a wider audience .
after consulting a few other scholars , mr. bird brought the text to the attention of the mark twain house and museum in hartford , which sold it to doubleday books for young readers .
erin stead , who did the illustrations , said they were very aware of the creative risks involved in taking on the work of such a towering literary figure .
â€ â€œ oleomargarine â€ is the latest abandoned children â€™ s tale to resurface decades after a revered writer â€™ s death .
twain â€™ s story may hold even greater literary significance for scholars and fans , because it represents a new genre for him .
it certainly wasn â€™ t for a lack of ideas .
â€œ the stories had to be absolutely original and fresh .
mr. bird stumbled on the manuscript in 2011 , when he was searching the twain archives for food references , for a mark twain cookbook .
the manuscript was just 16 handwritten pages long , and unfinished .
he eats it and discovers he can understand animals .
johnny and the animals go on a quest to rescue prince oleomargarine , who has been kidnapped by giants and taken to a cave guarded by dragons .
johnny was a recurring character in the nightly tales for the clemens girls , at least for a while .
he wrote his own version , which closely followed twain â€™ s blueprint and incorporated his language , and took the idea of publishing it to cindy lovell , who was then the executive director of the mark twain house and museum .
but mr. bird â€™ s version , which hewed to the original , was never published .
doubleday , which acquired rights to the story from the twain house , decided to hire the steads , who are stars in children â€™ s publishing , to finish the story .

a stiff wind and a small cloudburst caught my little suzuki as i entered town , setting off my shaky nerves .

in the parking lot , some friendly wild cockatoos were hanging around , scavenging for dropped food .
i hiked down the hill through the bush , a small , forested patch called the lorne queenscliff coastal reserve , past native trees and shrubs of common heath , soft and manna gum trees .
oh , and flies .
everywhere .
the flies in australia are relentless .
this continual shooing motion is sometimes called the aussie salute .
but i recommend investing in some bug spray .
the flies eased up once i emerged from the shade of the trees and reached the beach .
a long swath of sand greeted me , along with limpid ocean water and the sound of lapping waves .
i was the only person on the beach .
i was satisfied , too , with how i had started the trip â€” an important decision .
there is a local airport outside avalon , closer than melbourne to the start of the great ocean road , that i could have flown into ( on jetstar , an australian airline ) and rented a car .
i ended up driving most of the great ocean road in the suzuki , then doubling back near lavers hill when it got dark and heading back to melbourne .

as the invasion began , the winner of the election , adama barrow , was being sworn into office in a brief ceremony about 150 miles outside of gambia .
the inauguration took place in a nondescript room at the gambian embassy in dakar , senegal , because mr. barrow has so little control over his country that he did not go home for the funeral of his son , who had been killed by a dog over the weekend .
during the inauguration in senegal , mr. barrow arrived to enthusiastic whoops from hundreds of supporters and emerged from a motorcade beaming .
gambia has suffered high unemployment and political repression for years under mr. jammeh , with many citizens abandoning the country to risk perilous and often deadly journeys to europe by sea .
joining others in celebration in front of his welding shop with piles of metal , he took out his phone and called a relative in italy .

the cause of the crash was unknown as of thursday night .
justice zavascki â€™ s death raises important concerns about the direction of the petrobras investigation and the independence of the judiciary .
under brazilian law , the supreme court handles cases involving lawmakers and other senior politicians who enjoy special legal standing .
the plane carrying justice zavascki was owned by emiliano , a brazilian luxury hotel operator .
the owner of emiliano , carlos alberto filgueiras , 69 , and the pilot of the plane , osmar rodrigues , 56 , also died in the crash .
sergio moro , the judge overseeing much of the petrobras inquiry , called justice zavascki â€œ an example for all judges , prosecutors and lawyers in this country .
legal scholars agreed that brazil â€™ s supreme court , along with justice zavascki â€™ s replacement , would come under scrutiny .

â€™ â€ in march 1969 , tom smothers asked mr. steinberg to do another sermonette , although the network had banned the bit .
since those times , networks have learned that a certain amount of boundary pushing is healthy politicians have become more adept at manipulating tv and the people on the creative side have begun to understand that being on tv , especially in network prime time , requires compromises .
an edited and condensed version of the conversation follows .
q. let â€™ s begin with an indiscreet question .
a .
matings must have occurred then .
and later .
what does that mean for people who have it ?
it affects our skin .
it all depends on where on the genome it â€™ s located .
was there ever an upside to having neanderthal dna ?
when humans migrated into eurasia , they encountered unfamiliar hazards and pathogens .
yes .
neanderthal dna can mean you â€™ re more likely to get hooked on nicotine , even though there were no tobacco plants in archaic europe .
in this case and probably others , we think the neanderthal bits on the genome may serve as switches that turn human genes on or off .
aside from the neanderthals , do we know if our ancestors mated with other hominids ?
we think they did .
sometimes when we â€™ re examining genomes , we can see the genetic afterimages of hominids who haven â€™ t even been identified yet .
he extracted the dna , sequenced it and realized it was neither human nor neanderthal .
what paabo found was a previously unknown hominid he named denisovan , after the cave where it had been discovered .
fortunately , around that time â€” the early 2000s â€” it was becoming clear that people with computational skills could have a big impact in biology and genetics .
the human genome had just been mapped .
what an accomplishment !
so i switched over to biology .
there may be no written records from prehistory , but genomes are a living record .
â€ how did you feel when you read that ?
i was upset .
thousands of patients at vanderbilt consented to have their blood and their medical records deposited in a â€œ biobank â€ to find genetic diseases .
that â€™ s not being a â€œ parasite .
some of it â€™ s very touching .
some of it is a little silly .
â€œ i have a lot of hair on my legs â€” is that from neanderthals ? â€ but i received racist inquiries , too .
it was illogical .
actually , neanderthal dna is mostly bad for us â€” though that didn â€™ t bother them .
as you do your studies , do you ever wonder about what the lives of the neanderthals were like ?
it â€™ s hard not to .
genetics has taught us a tremendous amount about that , and there â€™ s a lot of evidence that they were much more human than apelike .
we tend to think of them as dumb and brutish .
maybe those of us of european heritage should be thinking , â€œ let â€™ s improve their standing in the popular imagination .
they â€™ re our ancestors , too .

provide staples like cooking equipment , cable tv , soap for bathing and cleaning , towels , toothpaste and toilet paper .
nobody trusts a host who is slow to respond .

on friday , apple , its longtime partner , sued qualcomm over what it said was $ 1 billion in withheld rebates .
the suit seeks the rebates , among other things .
the commission cited qualcomm â€™ s deals with taiwanese companies that manufacture apple iphones over semiconductors it sells for the iphone .
other smartphone chip makers have to pay qualcomm for that intellectual property , too .
the commission and apple complaints follow several other problems , including a $ 975 million fine by chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at qualcomm .
last month , qualcomm was fined $ 850 million in south korea for unfair patent licensing .
when apple provided information to south korean regulators in that case , and sought competing chips from intel , qualcomm refused to pay apple its promised money , apple said .
qualcomm has vowed to fight the south korean charge and the f. t. c. suit .
they have earned thousands of patents , including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores .
companies like samsung and apple need qualcomm for the technology that enables things like wireless video for millions of people at once .
its major technology is spread spectrum , which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones .
instead , qualcomm innovated in 4g wireless for the new smartphones from samsung and apple that toppled nokia and motorola .
6 billion and a profit of $ 5 .
7 billion .
apple â€™ s taiwanese manufacturers , which pay qualcomm royalties for iphones , are another big profit center .
the stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine , but not to the heights it reached before the problems .

qualcomm â€™ s lawyer figures the korean case may take years to move through the courts .
and recent events , including the impeachment of south korea â€™ s president and a bribery scandal at samsung , could complicate , or eliminate , qualcomm â€™ s regulatory issues there .

in other cases , republicans have rushed to the defense of nominees under fire , as when senator pat roberts , republican of kansas , suggested during mr. mnuchin â€™ s hearing that senator ron wyden , democrat of oregon , needed to take a valium .

when stomach pain kicked in , she saw a doctor to have it checked out .
that was her mistake .
but when the divorce became final , in 2008 , she lost health coverage from her husband â€™ s employer , and insurer after insurer refused to cover her because of the condition .
â€ her fortunes changed under the affordable care act , the major health law signed by president barack obama that required insurers to cover medical conditions .
she was one of the millions of people who jumped at the opportunity and bought a policy available under the new law .
about 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed , according to a recent study .
the thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up , the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers .
in 2014 , though , the pool was closed , and mr. nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the affordable care act .
it does not qualify as coverage under the law .
many states had to turn applicants away â€” in some states , only a small percentage of those who applied received coverage â€” and the insurance was sharply limited to control spending .
washington â€™ s annual maximum was $ 2 million , while california â€™ s limit was $ 75 , 000 a year .

other parts of the world are also considering whether to regulate foods and how to do so .
in europe , where many countries have banned the cultivation of g. m. o. s , the european commission has created a scientific panel to study the issue , with debate resuming this year .
dr. choulika said the inspiration for the october gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier , by parmentier , a french scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to europe from south america .
but many europeans scorned the potato .
france even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748 .
potatoes became a fixture in french cuisine .
â€œ things that you eat today , millions of people are going to eat during the 21st century , and this will not stop .
â€œ i think it is a question of perception .
â€œ better than olive oil , â€ dr. choulika said .

â€œ it will have effects .

health economists have long debated why .
strange as it may sound , how we care for our pets offers some answers .
( americans spent more than $ 15 billion on pet health care in 2015 , but $ 3 .
2 trillion on human health care . )
an estimated 68 percent of households have pets those families with higher incomes spend more , which is also true of human care .
and they spend more toward the end of humans â€™ and pets â€™ lives alike .
they note the united states spends more of its g. d. p. on health care than other similar advanced economies yet does not exhibit broadly better health outcomes , a sign of inefficiency .
but other economists argue that health care is so valuable that we might reasonably spend even more on it than we do today .
which camp is right ?
pet health insurance is also much less common .
human and pet health care are both provided by experts â€” doctors and veterinarians â€” who â€™ ve undergone lengthy and expensive training and occupational licensing .
it also gives them the authority to recommend treatments and tests , the need for which most consumers can not independently judge .
moreover , the need for care , whether it is for a pet or a human , is difficult to predict and often urgent , again threatening our ability and willingness to shop for the best deals .
some other policies also cover preventive care , like vaccinations .
is pet insurance a good deal ?
according to analysis by ms. finkelstein and her stanford colleagues , nearly of all pet care costs is spent by just 20 percent of households with pets .
though you might reasonably avoid pet care insurance , you really can â€™ t do that with human health insurance .

â€œ but it â€™ s hard to explain , really .
it â€™ s just all so hard to explain .
he died last march at 46 .
there was no clear answer to my question , only compartmentalized memories .
in the house on the lake , which kevin helped his parents buy , reminders of him appear at every turn .
when watching sunday â€™ s playoff games , you probably won â€™ t think about turner .
but you should .
the league agreed to a settlement for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars , and the first payouts from that litigation are expected in the coming months .
turner didn â€™ t live to see a penny of that settlement money .
the turners remember their son , who once weighed 235 pounds , dwindling to 100 .
and his left arm .
then his right arm and hand .
then his neck .
his mother had to learn how to thicken water so he wouldn â€™ t choke while drinking it , and how to clean his breathing and feeding tubes .
by the end , kevin couldn â€™ t eat , drink , swallow or talk , as he fought for each breath .
his parents think it is important to tell their story , to raise awareness about c. t. e. they take no offense at questions about why they haven â€™ t turned their backs on football .
they just watch differently .
â€œ he was just sitting there and i thought , â€˜ wow , how can he sit there with no emotion at all ? â€™ then i realized , oh , yeah , i do know why .

who bought the patriots 23 years ago for a $ 172 million , chalks up such animosity to the team â€™ s success .
he has an apartment in manhattan , and in the years after he bought the team , he would get razzed by people on the street .
kraft , whose billions come primarily from a packaging and paper empire and an assortment of other investments , sidestepped questions about whether winning a super bowl would have any extra meaning this year .
among n. f. l. owners , whose politics tilt republican , kraft is among the most loyal donors to democratic candidates .
patriots fans , too , lashed out at kraft for not doing more to fight the n. f. l. during deflategate .
like arabs and jews .
he has taken dozens of christian friends to israel , including brady and , in 2015 , 19 former n. f. l. players , some of whom were baptized in the jordan river .

â€ stallworth added : â€œ he doesn â€™ t walk around like he owns the place , even though he does .
â€ indeed , kraft was very at home in his office , which is stuffed with photos , memorabilia and knickknacks .
mr. barrow , 51 , has been stuck in neighboring senegal for a week , waiting for the incumbent he defeated , yahya jammeh , to step down and leave the country .
a coalition of other african countries sent troops into gambia to evict mr. jammeh by force if necessary , and on saturday night , mr. jammeh finally let go .
â€ mr. jammeh , who took office after a 1994 coup , imprisoned numerous journalists and political opponents during his tenure , some of whom died in jail .
officials released a joint declaration by the united nations , the african union and the economic community of west african states on sunday that â€œ assures and ensures the dignity , respect , security and rights â€ of mr. jammeh , his family and his loyal supporters , so that â€œ there is no intimidation , harassment of former regime members and supporters .

rescue workers struggled into the early morning to pull the injured passengers and dead bodies from the engine and nine coaches , the authorities said .
the accident took place in the vizianagaram district of andhra pradesh state in southern india , when the engine and coaches of the hirakhand express from jagdalpur to bhubaneshwar derailed at 11:15 p. m. according to a statement issued by indian railways , the firm that runs india â€™ s trains .

indian railways announced compensation of 200 , 000 rupees , about $ 2 , 937 , to the families of the dead , and 50 , 000 rupees , or about $ 734 , to injured passengers .

in a sign of how chinese politics has chilled , mr. yang has said little publicly about the book .
â€ mr. yang , 76 , was a university student in beijing when the cultural revolution erupted .
but now he is often denounced by maoists emboldened by the pronouncements .
party journals have attacked his conclusion that up to 36 million people died in a famine from 1958 caused by the great leap forward , mao â€™ s reckless attempt to leap into a communist utopia , which mr. yang chronicled in â€œ tombstone .
â€ that book was published in chinese in hong kong in 2008 .
piles of mr. yang â€™ s book in bookstores there suggest that mainland readers have been buying copies to sneak across the border , despite customs checks .
â€œ mr .
â€œ but an electronic version of â€˜ tombstone â€™ has been floating around since 2008 , and an enormous amount of pirated copies has been distributed by small book vendors .
if false , they could damage the times â€™ s reputation .
but was that the right decision ?
while his findings were difficult to confirm , times reporting bore out that he was respected in his craft .
there were disagreements about whether to hold back .
anybody that thinks we sat on stuff is outrageous .
it â€™ s just false .
but the idea that you only publish once every piece of information is in and fully vetted is a false construct .
weeks after the times had the goods , franklin foer of slate and david corn of mother jones each took a turn at such articles .
their stories may not have been precisely what the times would have done , but they offered a model .
if the times didn â€™ t write about ongoing investigations , it wouldn â€™ t have produced the excellent scoop on trump associates and russia that broke thursday night .
among them was michael russo of brooklyn , who had this to say : there is an unsettling theme that runs through the times â€™ s publishing decisions .
in each instance , it was the actions of government officials that triggered newsroom decisions â€” not additional reporting or insight that journalists gained .
that gave the times cover to write what it knew about the bureau â€™ s investigation into the bank server .
it was the same pattern on the dossier .
but the briefing became justifiable cause to publish .
in this game between government and press , the government won .

friends scoff at this extravagant concern .
â€œ that couldn â€™ t happen here in america , not possibly ! â€ they assure him .
but jessup , a vermont newspaper editor and a â€œ mild , rather indolent and somewhat sentimental liberal , â€ worries about the devastation ahead .
â€œ what can i do ? â€ he agonizes night after night .
at the time , the obvious specter was adolf hitler , whose rise to power in germany provoked fears that men like the louisiana senator huey long or the radio priest charles coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the united states .
within a week of the 2016 election , the book was reportedly sold out on amazon .
com .
yet the graphic horrors of lewis â€™ s vision also limit the book â€™ s usefulness as a guide to our own political moment .
in 1935 , lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable : the election of a candidate to the presidency of the united states .
lewis â€™ s second wife , the journalist dorothy thompson , provided much of the inspiration for â€œ it can â€™ t happen here .
â€ in 1931 , she interviewed hitler , scoffing at his â€œ startling insignificance â€ when encountered .
back in the united states , thompson interviewed huey long , who had vowed to challenge franklin roosevelt for the presidency in 1936 .
she noted that long â€™ s populist message and swaggering style reminded her of hitler , and according to lewis â€™ s biographer , richard lingeman , lewis took the message to heart .
a recent nobel prize winner , known for his superhuman productivity , lewis churned out the entire manuscript of â€œ it can â€™ t happen here â€ between may and august of 1935 .
the novel arrived in bookstores that october .
lewis â€™ s book nonetheless sold 320 , 000 copies , becoming his most popular work to date .
â€ what propelled its popularity was a sense of urgency , the worry that the united states â€” like the nations of western europe â€” might contain dark forces yet to be unleashed .
a slightly different sense of urgency seems to be fueling the book â€™ s latest surge in popularity .
â€ his movement style evokes the of nazi germany rather than the anonymous jabs of the twitter mob .
like trump , windrip sells himself as the champion of â€œ forgotten men , â€ determined to bring dignity and prosperity back to america â€™ s white working class .
his supporters embrace this message , lashing out against the â€œ highbrow intellectuality â€ of editors and professors and policy elites .
with windrip â€™ s encouragement , they also take out their frustrations on blacks and jews .
it is sarason , not windrip , who actually writes â€œ zero hour , â€ the candidate â€™ s popular jeremiad on national decline .
it is only after the inauguration , though , that â€œ it can â€™ t happen here â€ takes a truly dark turn .
the novel gains its energy from jessup â€™ s internal struggle , his regret at having done so little to stop it all while he still could .
â€œ it â€™ s the fault of doremus jessup !
of all the conscientious , respectable , doremus jessups , who have let the demagogues wriggle in , without fierce enough protest .
while the book skewers jessup â€™ s passivity , however , it does little to suggest viable modes of engagement under the windrip regime , short of abandoning home and family and fleeing to canada .
every time jessup attempts some modest act of resistance , he is met with the ruthless repression of the state .
when jessup prints a righteous editorial , windrip â€™ s goons arrest him and murder his .
jessup ends up as a in a concentration camp , beaten down but determined to carry on .
by the book â€™ s closing pages , jessup has returned to the united states as a disciplined resistance fighter , organizing armed rebellions throughout the midwest .
his transformation illustrates lewis â€™ s most powerful message : when it happens here , everyone should be prepared to resist .
but jessup â€™ s story also underscores how difficult it can be to sort out what to do at moments of swift political change and social confusion .
523,17878 , is this los angeles â€™ s $ 600 million man ?
- the new york times , new york times , adam nagourney,2017-01-23,2017.0,1.0 , , '' los angeles â€” michael govan stood in a gallery scattered with paintings and crates at the los angeles county museum of art , his arms gesturing at blank white walls , his face furled in thought .
â€œ a little to the left .
â€œ awesome .
â€œ horrified .
mr. govan needed the diversion .
the project , a decidedly disruptive and not entirely admired design by the architect peter zumthor , is testing all the social , political and skills that mr. govan has acquired after 10 years of maneuvering in a west coast caldron of art collectors , wealthy patrons , celebrities and government officials .
he has had exhibitions devoted to tim burton , mr. gehry and robert mapplethorpe .
6 million people .
â€œ and that â€™ s what he has done with lacma and l. a .
mr. govan scrunched up his face at the suggestion as he sat on a gallery bench last month at the press preview of an exhibition devoted to the works of pablo picasso and diego rivera .
â€ and there may be no better example of than the zumthor building .
it â€™ s recycled , pumped up to monumental scale .
â€ it is , as mr. govan is quick to acknowledge , a controversial design by mr. zumthor , a widely admired architect .
there are some people who don â€™ t like zumthor or his design .
it â€™ s controversial .
( the expanded san francisco museum of modern art , which opened last spring , raised $ 610 million in its capital campaign , easily covering the $ 305 million cost of its building expansion . )
â€œ l .
â€ from the start , mr. govan has been persistent and uncompromisingly confident .
â€œ the question is , will people decide that â€™ s what they want to do with it .
â€ there is a sort of cautious optimism here that mr. govan will be able to wrangle his money , all the more so since he announced the latest $ 75 million , including $ 50 million from elaine wynn , an art collector who is the of the museum , and $ 25 million from a. jerrold perenchio , a former univision chairman who has bequeathed the bulk of his art estate to the new museum .

â€œ it â€™ s our time .

- the new york times , new york times , jeffrey gettleman,2017-01-24,2017.0,1.0 , , '' nairobi , kenya â€” tens of thousands of civilians dead , countless children on the verge of starvation , millions of dollars stolen by officials , oil wells blown up , food aid hijacked and as many as 70 percent of women sheltering in camps raped â€” mostly by the nation â€™ s soldiers and police officers .
of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in africa , the south sudanese actually won .
now , with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war , a radical question has emerged : should south sudan lose its independence ?
as international frustrations and worries grow , some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over south sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down .
for that matter , so does mr. padiet , a scholar who is not a dinka .
he called trusteeship â€œ offensive â€ because south sudan has a potential crop of good leaders waiting in the wings who haven â€™ t had a chance to rule .
it â€™ s all a staggering plunge from the country â€™ s birth .
i , along with hundreds of other journalists , was standing in a crowd that felt like a million people on july 9 , 2011 , the insanely hot day when south sudan broke off from sudan .
the sense of pride , sacrifice , hope and jubilation will be hard to forget .
for decades , south sudanese rebels had battled the central government of sudan .
they fought in malarial swamps and on sweltering savannas , incredibly hostile environments where it â€™ s hard to survive , let alone wage a guerrilla war on a shoestring .
the south sudanese had absorbed bombings and massacres .
the arabs stole their children and turned them into slaves .
on independence day , south sudan â€™ s capital , juba , partied until dawn .
that crumbled quickly , undermined by old political rivalries , ethnic tension and a greed for south sudan â€™ s one main export : oil .
women were raped .
children were burned to death .
some people were even forced at gunpoint to eat the flesh of their dead relatives .
for years , the united nations has stationed thousands of peacekeepers in the country , but often they have not intervened .
in 2012 , shortly after independence , i rushed to a remote town , pibor , where hundreds had just been massacred by an ethnic militia .
â€ other scholars take a middle view .
â€ but she worries that no country has the appetite to spearhead a meaningful intervention .
it â€™ s not as if mr. kiir or mr. machar or their inner circles , who are widely believed to continue to profit from oil and conflict , are going to volunteer to step aside .

the entire spectrum of shanghai â€™ s life took place in them : shikumen housed nurseries and coffin makers , universities and buddhist temples , hotels and zones ( the infamous alley of joint pleasure was home to 171 brothels ) .
demolitions began in the 1990s , and intensified in the to expo 2010 .

other shikumen are scattered among shanghai â€™ s office and residential towers .
in the late â€™ 90s , the small factories and shikumen homes along lane 210 on taikang road were occupied by painters , sculptors and ceramists .
their tiny workshops eventually became a complex of 200 cultural and art sites , with older residents continuing to occupy apartments .

the meeting in astana , meant to send the message that russia would seek to resolve the conflict in its sphere of influence , was markedly different from the united talks that have taken place in recent winters in geneva .
palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside , as a duo wearing evening gowns played â€œ strangers in the night â€ and the theme from â€œ titanic .
â€ western diplomats , largely sidelined , huddled in the hotel â€™ s irish pub , and the united states ambassador to kazakhstan , who was invited over iran â€™ s objections and attended only as an observer , avoided reporters .
the united nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role in the talks in astana , but mr. de mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator and was shuttling between the delegations who were in separate rooms .
western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in astana could be a russian effort to ultimately replace the geneva discussions , which the russian government has criticized .

but representatives of the syrian delegations â€” both from the government and opposition â€” immediately expressed reservations .
russia is the most powerful backer of the syrian government , which is also closely allied with iran , while turkey has been among the main supporters of rebel groups .
water supplies have been cut off for weeks , and the government and rebel sides have blamed each other .
the agreement among iran , russia and turkey was announced a day after the syrian factions exchanged harsh words at the start of the talks , held in astana , capital of kazakhstan .
there had been tentative hopes among some rebel negotiators that russia might be ready to take on a more active role in seeking a political compromise .
but there was no concrete progress on political issues , which were excluded from the narrowly focused talks .
â€ those sentiments echo principles that the united nations security council has laid out .
the agreement did not specify how such a separation might occur , however .

over the ensuing weeks , guided by the partisans , they trekked through mountains and valleys , sometimes cutting back or traveling in circles to avoid german patrols , living in the open or sheltering in villages and sharing cornbread with peasants .
the americans were soon listed as missing in action , and war department telegrams , beginning â€œ regret to inform you , â€ were sent to their families back home .

indira pleaded not to involve the police , explaining that her mother did not have a driver â€™ s license because she was not an american citizen .

indira â€™ s determination to become a doctor requires more than a little imagination , because under current law in georgia and many other states , licenses to practice medicine are reserved for citizens and legal residents .
over columbus day weekend , she visited washington for the first time with her roommate , karen baltazar , who is from lawrenceville , ga. and also wants to be a doctor .

there is , in fact , a difference between investigating actual voter fraud and cleaning up the voter rolls .
that was followed by a contrite apology and lots of pretty pictures .
but the national parks took up the cause , with a twitter storm on climate change from the badlands that was quickly taken down .
but republicans weren â€™ t too keen on the notion of the federal government swooping into to fight city crime .
it was about their lives and their jobs .
mr. lewandowski just recently set up shop down the street from the white house in a consulting and lobbying firm he runs with another former trump adviser , barry bennett .
a representative for the firm told buzzfeed that the listing was generated by them and not mr. mook and mr. lewandowski .
mr. burchfield , a washington lawyer who has represented george h. w. bush and the republican national committee , was appointed as independent ethics adviser to the trump organization , meaning he will advise on avoiding conflicts of interest , with the power to sign off on certain transactions .
after calling it the â€œ worst trade deal , â€ he seems to be softening his stance .
it has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the united states and added to discontent in the communities that lost them .
â€ so what might that actually mean ?
what is nafta ?
by 1994 , the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that , in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages , lashed their economies together .
but there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon .
united states exports to mexico , for example , are now 3 .
5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation .
they have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy .
trade between the united states and canada has been pretty well balanced over time , but the united states has had about a $ 60 billion per year trade deficit with mexico , importing more than it exports .
the impact on jobs and incomes in the united states is less clear .
economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the united states toward more productive work , raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs .
in theory , yes .
it â€™ s more likely to reopen the deal .
we don â€™ t know for sure , but some hints have emerged .
they are .
the tax is 16 percent in mexico when a mexican firm exports goods to the united states , it receives a rebate for the tax it paid , and when a u. s. firm exports to mexico , a comparable adjustment is added .
mr. ross , the commerce secretary nominee , and peter navarro , a trump white house trade adviser , argued in a white paper during the campaign that this amounts to an unfair export subsidy that penalizes the united states .
canada and mexico aren â€™ t likely to see it that way , and will resist if the united states seeks a change to the rules so that a vat adjustment is no longer added to u. s. exports into their countries .
but a deal should get done , right ?
maybe .
s. a. precheck â€ security line at the airport ) .
mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the united states .
but that â€™ s the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal .
is there a chance nafta completely blows up ?
there is â€” though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion .
even that wouldn â€™ t necessarily be painless , however .
â€ just how urgent is renegotiating nafta ?
robert e. scott , the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal economic policy institute , sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the united states and china , japan , south korea and even germany .
mexican governments over the last have consistently pushed back against the nation â€™ s historical resentment toward the united states , hoping to build a more cooperative relationship with its overbearing northern neighbor .
but these aren â€™ t normal times .
it must convince mr. trump that if he blows up the trade agreement on which mexico has staked its hopes of development , by weaving its economy ever more closely into that of the united states , the united states will suffer , too .
ending nafta would hurt the united states : six million american jobs depend on exports to mexico , according to mexican officials .
let mr. trump pull the united states out of nafta , he argues .
â€œ and let â€™ s see if his wall keeps the terrorists out , because we won â€™ t , â€ mr. castaÃ±eda added .
the view from mexico city is not uniformly bleak .
â€ the view that there is a potential silver lining to mr. trump â€™ s hostility toward nafta is also popular in some washington circles .
the agreement is due for some modernization anyway , if only to deal with things like data protection , online crime and â€” which were not around in the early 1990s .
gary hufbauer of the peterson institute for international economics in washington suggests that the name â€œ nafta â€ be retired â€” it has a bad reputation .
if canada stays out of the fray , cutting a separate deal with the united states to replace nafta , mexico would be left alone in an existential fight for its future .
in this case , mexico may have no choice but to raise the stakes and hope to arrive at the negotiating table with a threat at least as credible as mr. trump â€™ s promise to pull out of the deal .
now it â€™ s worth about 22 .
a frontal confrontation with the united states might send it to 40 , mexican officials fear , fueling capital flight .
and yet that may be mexico â€™ s strongest card .
that â€™ s if mexico manages to hold on .

at the time she was preparing to try to leverage her tv success into a film career , having recently signed a contract with universal .

â€ early coverage was similarly dismissive : â€œ mary tyler moore is caught in a preposterous item about life as an â€˜ associate producer â€™ in a tv newsroom , â€ jack gould wrote in the times in a preview of the 1970 tv season .
the following year , the times was revealing â€œ why 30 million are mad about mary .

â€ ms. moore â€™ s career never again reached the heights of â€œ the mary tyler moore show , â€ but she stayed busy branching out into musicals and additional , series , and playing against plucky type in tv movies and films like â€œ ordinary people â€ and â€œ flirting with disaster .
in 2012 , neil genzlinger , a television critic for the times , watched the series finale of â€œ the mary tyler moore show â€ with the actress , who apologized in advance for a watery eye that had been plaguing her .

are you married ?
divorced ?
what religion are you ?
she calls him out but answers anyway , in the show â€™ s first episode .

which raises the question : what was the version ?
recently , the franchise has been redesigned and reconceived .
the familiar characters are back , as are landmarks like pop â€™ s chock â€™ lit shoppe .
but it â€™ s a dark , bitter milkshake that â€œ riverdale â€ concocts , built on the suspicion that any town this squeaky clean must be hiding decay , corruption and secrets .
and jeepers , are there secrets .
the whole archieverse is hotter and more haunted .
veronica lodge ( camila mendes ) the spellbinding rich girl , is now a transplant from manhattan whose father is in jail for fraud .
kevin keller ( casey cott ) a gay student , was introduced in the recent comics .
the town is beset with bullying , sexual harassment and abuse .
jughead ( cole sprouse ) the wry , sidekick of the comics , is now a dour , emo narrator .
â€ finding the corrosion under the chassis of america is itself an old trope .
â€ â€œ riverdale â€ is very conscious of its influences â€” too much so at times .
â€œ you may be a stock character from a â€™ 90s teen movie , â€ cheryl snipes at veronica , â€œ but i â€™ m not .
â€ she â€™ s right â€” cheryl is more like a stock character from â€œ glee .
in another touch of he spars with his father , played by luke perry , who practically invented soulful teen brooding on â€œ beverly hills 90210 .
â€ if the tone is not yet consistent , the aesthetic is , a strong sign that â€œ riverdale â€ knows what it wants to be .
the terrific art direction warps the iconography into something haunting and lurid .
take archie and the blossom twins â€™ hair â€” so red that it â€™ s clownish , like dyed cotton candy .
what the original comics drew as milky and wholesome , â€œ riverdale â€ dials up to ghostly and unnatural .
â€ within hours , that is just what happened .
â€œ we have no choice .
boom .
done .
there are a hundred other things .
the government would impose a 20 percent tax on corporate income earned in the united states , which would have the effect of taxing imports while exempting exports .
the goods that the united states imported from mexico in 2015 were worth about $ 60 billion more than the goods it exported to mexico , so federal revenue in the short term would increase by roughly $ 12 billion .
it would be paid by companies selling mexican goods in the united states .
many economists also doubt that the change would end up penalizing imports or encouraging exports .
they predict that the value of the dollar would rise , offsetting those effects .
the reality of what sean spicer , the press secretary , suggested is a lot less dramatic .
and the policy may violate world trade organization rules , which could tangle it up in legal proceedings .
but the latest tea leaves suggest the administration is more open to it than it may have seemed .
but money is fungible .
it is a messy time for the making of economic policy .
then on thursday morning , mr. trump fired back , warning that he might cancel the meeting himself if mexico did not agree to pay for the wall .

on wednesday , mr. trump signed an order to build it and announced that work would begin immediately on a project that is estimated to cost more than $ 20 billion .
not entirely .
according to a draft of the order , mr. trump also intends to review the agency â€™ s interrogation program , in which interrogators tortured some suspected terrorists through waterboarding and extensive sleep deprivation .
other suspects were shackled in painful positions , doused with water and menaced with dogs .
a. prisons , but it would take much more than his signature to restore the interrogation program .
federal law now restricts interrogation techniques to those authorized by the army field manual .
but his cabinet nominees seemed to reject that theory in their confirmation testimony .
8 million ballots only because undocumented immigrants and others voted illegally .
voter fraud is a crime , so mr. trump may have been referring to an f. b. i. investigation .
those require a criminal predicate , or reasonable suspicion .

â€œ that â€™ s why you have no power , â€ he added .
â€œ you were humiliated .

republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion border wall , perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid , money to fight the zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in flint , mich .
even on the subject of mr. trump â€™ s call for an investigation into voter fraud , a widely debunked claim , republicans have often demurred .
in an apparent reference to forthcoming bills , he added , â€œ we â€™ re actually going to sign the stuff that you â€™ re writing .
you â€™ re not wasting your time .
â€ congressional republicans are also struggling to keep up with mr. trump â€™ s announcements , let alone push their agenda .
investigating voter fraud , for instance , is not something he would like to see congress take on .
they are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda â€” specifically a repeal and , ostensibly , a replacement of the affordable care act .
â€œ we are on the same page with the white house , â€ mr. ryan insisted thursday .
â€œ the president agrees with this agenda .
2 senate republican , called democrats â€™ request for $ 600 million in aid to flint added to an energy bill â€œ a huge earmark , â€ adding , â€œ i think it â€™ s not something i could support , â€ in keeping with most of his colleagues .

8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election .
now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting .
it â€™ s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast , but whether there â€™ s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all .
the study â€™ s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error : the possibility that people taking a survey don â€™ t answer a question correctly â€” in this case , a question about being american citizens .
there is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys .
respondents might not understand the question .
the survey â€” the cooperative congressional election study â€” was huge , with 38 , 000 respondents in 2008 .
and the group in question â€” noncitizens â€” was very small , just 339 of those respondents .
imagine , for instance , that 99 .
if the people were consistent , they were probably noncitizens .
if voters were inconsistent , it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship .
the critics concluded that â€œ the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent u. s. elections is 0 .
instead , the october response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting .
but the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote .
it is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file .
â€œ that doesn â€™ t mean that the rate is exactly zero .
but it does mean that it â€™ s frequency that we can â€™ t even measure it with traditional methods .

mrs. may has sought to win over mr. trump , whom she will visit this week , just as her european counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about american reliability .
second is european unity , which is essential for britain â€™ s economic prosperity and , by removing the diversions of european conflict , frees up britain to act on the world stage .
but both of those pillars could now be crumbling under the strain of european populism , russian resurgence and particularly mr. trump â€™ s threats to step away from europe .
but this risks encouraging more exits from the bloc and possibly its disintegration .
mrs. may remains hawkish on russia .
whereas leaders such as ms. merkel have responded sharply to criticism from mr. trump , mrs. may has been more forgiving .
britain â€™ s party politics also distract .
that has ramifications beyond britain .
as he prepares to host prime minister theresa may of britain at the white house on friday , he intends to begin discussions on a agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries .
but as a spur to economic expansion and hiring , a deal would almost certainly amount to very little .

british steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of american beef .
it would seek protection , particularly as britain â€™ s exit from the bloc would eliminate european subsidies for british agriculture .
last year , before britain â€™ s referendum , mr. obama visited the country and urged voters to opt for remaining in europe .
he sought to undercut a key aspiration of those urging a break from the bloc â€” the prospect that a more independent britain could strike a deal with the united states .
if it sought a trade deal with the united states , britain would land â€œ in the back of the queue , â€ mr. obama warned .
in recent weeks , mrs. may has labored to displace that notion by describing britain as a land of dauntless capitalists scouring the planet for fresh opportunities .

the mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry .
moreover , both tesla and solarcity benefit from federal subsidies .
robert e. murray , a coal executive and trump supporter , has called mr. musk â€œ a fraud â€ for accepting $ 2 billion in government handouts .
( it was trading this week at about $ 255 . )
and mr. musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a white house meeting this week at which , according to a participant , he broached the subject of a carbon tax .
surprisingly , mr. trump didn â€™ t reject it out of hand .
â€ ( coal , by contrast , accounts for about 86 , 000 workers . )
mr. musk has stressed that solar energy is close to reaching a scale where federal subsidies will no longer be needed .
and tesla is also expanding rapidly .
federal subsidies for electric vehicles will also end once a manufacturer hits 200 , 000 vehicles , a level tesla may soon reach .
mr. musk has broached the subject of the nation â€™ s aging electricity transmission grid in conversations with mr. trump , according to an insider with knowledge of the discussions .

dr. bloom had informed the crew that her teenage sons had severe nut allergies .
we brought our own food , and we â€™ re comfortable staying on the plane. â€™ i offered to sign a waiver , â€ said dr. bloom , an orthodontist in clarksville , md .
but the practice also presents a challenge to travelers with severe nut allergies , who can suffer a reaction simply by touching a surface that has been exposed to nuts .
but tensions between passengers with food allergies and airline staff members have risen in recent years , as airlines have begun to enforce stricter rules related to preboarding passengers .
in the past , parents of young children could board the plane early , giving them a chance to wipe down seats , trays and armrests to reduce exposure to allergens .
but today many airlines have stopped letting families with children board before other passengers .
although nobody tracks medical emergencies on airplanes , studies show that medical emergencies are relatively uncommon and affect only a fraction of the estimated 3 .
6 billion passengers who fly each year .
we are not able to provide nut â€˜ buffer zones , â€™ nor are we able to allow passengers to to wipe down seats and tray tables .
individuals who suffer from severe , food allergies can experience swelling and difficulty breathing after even a mild exposure .
they usually carry an which contains epinephrine , a medication that can reverse the symptoms .
but in the case of a severe reaction , a person may still need urgent access to a medical facility .
research has shown that taking steps like creating buffer zones , in which nearby passengers are asked to refrain from eating nut products , and wiping down seats and trays may reduce the risk of an allergic reaction in flight .
she was not allowed to preboard to clean the seat before the family â€™ s trip last fall from portland , ore. to charlotte , n. c. the second complaint was filed on jan. 10 on behalf of food allergy research education ( fare ) an organization that represents individuals with all kinds of food allergies .
some airlines are more accommodating to passengers with food allergies .
jet blue will create a â€œ buffer zone â€ around an allergic passenger .
delta â€™ s policy is also to refrain from serving peanuts if an allergic passenger is onboard .

the chinese transportation authorities have estimated that people will make close to three billion journeys over this lunar new year travel period , including 356 million trips by train .
many people take multiple journeys â€” by train and bus â€” to get home and then return to work , so the actual number of bodies on the move is lower than those numbers may suggest .

they wander through a replica of mr. ban â€™ s old house .
despite criticism of his tenure there , mr. ban is seen as a role model by vast numbers of south koreans .
when mr. ban arrived home on jan. 12 , crowds of turned out at the airport , waving flags and shouting , â€œ ban please save this country ! â€ yet there is also deep skepticism about his potential presidential bid , especially among the nation â€™ s progressives .
â€ in the words of critics .
( the word â€œ ban â€ in korean means â€œ half .
â€ ) mr. ban calls himself â€œ a child of the united nations , â€ part of a generation of south koreans who remembered united nations handouts in the destitute years after the korean war , as well as united nations forces who fought in the war .
many of his contemporaries view the united states as south korea â€™ s savior and protector .
they believe the political class has been disgraced by ms. park â€™ s corruption scandal and yet is also desperate for a candidate it can support in an election that could take place as early as this spring .
as mr. ban crisscrossed the country after his return , paying homage to the dead at national cemeteries and shaking hands with street vendors , his detractors trailed him , holding signs that called him â€œ an opportunist , â€ or worse .
critics called mr. ban a turncoat when he later appeared to align himself closely with conservatives , including ms. park .
his popularity rating as a presidential contender has plummeted in the wake of ms. park â€™ s scandal .
with his popularity ratings stuck behind mr. moon â€™ s , the usually mr. ban began bridling at criticism .
( he later apologized . )
he has also called himself a mr. clean , responding to the outcry over ms. park â€™ s scandal .
mr. ban denies involvement .
yet here in his home province of chungcheong , pride in mr. ban is compared to a personality cult by his critics .
â€ in eumseong , the seat of the county that includes this village , a park displays a circle of bronze busts of mr. ban and other former united nations secretaries general .
and this hamlet , which has only a dozen households , is a veritable ban theme park .
a monument erected by the local ban clan calls him a â€œ sacred peak of the world â€ whose â€œ warm smile dissipated international conflicts .
â€ visitors stroll around the â€œ ban peace land , â€ a small park with a granite monument in the shape of the united nations headquarters surrounded by flags of member states .
older villagers remember the young mr. ban walking on a dirt road with his eyes fixated on an english textbook .
a roadside motel here added more rooms because so many newlyweds believed that if their firstborns were conceived with the blessing of the energy of the mountains surrounding the village , they would grow up to be luminaries like mr. ban .
but another visitor , kim also a ban fan , feared that mr. ban might not survive the thrust and parry of domestic politics .

many technical and ethical barriers have yet to be overcome , but the research is advancing alongside the acute need for organs some 76 , 000 people in the united states alone are awaiting transplants .
creating chimeras , especially those with human cells , may prove controversial , given the possibility that test animals could be humanized in undesirable ways .
in 2005 , senator sam brownback of kansas introduced a bill imposing a $ 1 million fine on anyone creating and profiting from a chimera with human cells in its brain or reproductive tissues .
the n. i. h. proposed last august to lift the ban , but to require grant proposals involving the insertion of human stem cells into early animal embryos to be examined by an expert committee .
.
after each discovery there were hopes of converting the cells into therapeutic tissues by exposing them in glassware to the sequence of natural chemicals that in the living embryo directs them into constructing the heart , brain , lungs and other organs .
this may be why glassware experiments with stem cells have not yet lived up to their full promise .
so i thought , â€˜ why not let nature do the job ?
generating inviting homes for the donor cells may reduce the risk that they will be incorporated in nontarget tissues like the brain or reproductive tissues .
in practice , about 10 percent of the mouse pancreases generated in rats was composed of rat cells , because the rat supplies the blood vessels for the organ .
but the rat blood vessels seem to be quickly replaced when the organs are transferred to mice .
chimeras will be more immediately useful in studying human embryogenesis , testing drugs and following the progress of disease .
in mice , this has already been done for the pancreas , heart and eye .
they must then show that human stem cells can construct such an organ in a pig .
since the pig will supply the blood vessels and nerves , these will need to be replaced by the recipient â€™ s cells after transplant without triggering immune rejection .
if rejection does occur , the researchers will have to knock out the pig â€™ s vasculature genes and arrange for these too to be humanized .
both scientists expressed confidence that ethical concerns about chimera research could be addressed .
â€œ this isn â€™ t dangerous research .
â€ concern about human cells â€™ incorporation into a lower animal â€™ s brain is not without basis .

637,18001 , sympathy for the blue devils ?
the blue devils began the season at no .

the cameron crazies , filling up the risers on the western side of the arena , are aggressive in trying to knock opposing players .

the fact that students will put down stakes â€” up to 100 tents â€” for several weeks for a chance at prime seating inside cameron ( particularly for games against north carolina ) is an indisputable testament to the students â€™ zeal .

google â€™ s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use adsense .
â€ google and facebook have been in something of a situation in recent months when it comes to fake news .
both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale , and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms .
google in november said it would ban sites that spread misinformation from adsense as a way to impair how such sites make money .
it took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently .
this month , media matters noted that google changed the language of its advertising policy , removing the words â€œ fake news .
google declined to identify the sites or publishers it banned .
before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers , google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of â€œ misrepresentative content , â€ such as websites peddling schemes or counterfeit goods .
the publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads , with a portion of the proceeds going to google .
facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since november .

the story itself was a brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 los angeles its climax involved a humiliating assault on a latino man by racist united states servicemen .
just a decade earlier , its writer and director , luis valdez , was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the central valley in california .
but audiences kept coming , and coming , selling out show after packed show .
â€œ it was like this huge explosion .
â€ on tuesday , jan. 31 , a revival of â€œ zoot suit â€ begins its run at the taper , kicking off the theater â€™ s season .
a fantastical reimagining of the sleepy lagoon murder case , in which 12 latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge , â€œ zoot suit â€ features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids , lively swing tunes and family squabbles .
the show is both a homecoming and a reunion .
daniel valdez ( luis â€™ s brother ) and rose portillo , who in 1978 portrayed henry reyna and della barrios , the young lovers at the heart of the play , this time around play henry â€™ s parents .
karen zacarias started the young playwrights â€™ theater in 1995 in 2003 , nilo cruz became the first latino to win a pulitzer for drama .
the men were strutting , the women spinning , but when a rival gang arrived , colorful curses flew , then fists , and before you knew it , the switchblades were out .
el pachuco snapped his fingers , stopping time just as henry was about to cut his rival â€™ s throat .
â€œ i didn â€™ t invent that stuff .
that wasn â€™ t agitprop .
â€ â€œ the second zoot suit riot begins , â€ an ad in a local newspaper declared in 1978 .
â€œ that was probably hatched right here in this office , â€ mr. valdez laughed .
â€œ but there was a rush for tickets , so in that sense , it was a riot .
an artistic riot .
the taper , which also hosted the world premiere productions of â€œ angels in america â€ and â€œ children of a lesser god , â€ hopes to create a similar buzz this time around .
the altamed art collection in los angeles is lending art that will be on display in the theater lobby .
â€œ you can feel the buzz in the hallways .
now , watching the casting calls and the dance auditions , they â€™ re absolutely amazing .
â€ the nationwide call drew 800 actors for 25 parts , and most cast members have backgrounds in film and tv .
he traces lines from the internment camps to the zoot suit riots , from black lives matter to the vilification of muslims .
â€œ it â€™ s like the closing of a complete circle .
â€œ it â€™ s different .
the lengths are longer .
there â€™ s more fabric .
but it â€™ s very cool !

but other foods produced mainly in the united states might become slightly cheaper .
multinationals like apple actually pay a lot less , in part because much of their profits are held offshore .
that is harder for an onion farmer to do , although there are tax breaks for farmers .
the tax burden would be shifted toward importers , but also toward people who buy imported goods .
onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more .
a corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally , which is the whole idea behind a border tax .
that is tough to predict , and also depends on inflation and other factors , not just the border tax .

the mexican government , they say , may not be able to handle it .
yet some international officials and advocates envision a potential nightmare for the country .
â€ even before this week , mexico was facing extraordinary migration pressures .
nearly all the deportees in recent years have been from central america .
haitian migrants , traveling from brazil , began arriving in this border city last spring .
for a while , the haitians had little trouble crossing into the united states .
more than 30 shelters are providing for the haitians , yet none are .
most of the burden of sheltering , feeding , clothing and caring for the nonstop stream of haitians has fallen to civil society groups and individuals , who have accused the government of doing too little too late .
federal officials have rejected the criticism that they have been neglectful .
â€œ is there room to do more ?
â€œ it â€™ s been a struggle .
â€ â€œ but , â€ he added , â€œ it isn â€™ t true that the governments have been unresponsive .
â€ the crisis , now in its ninth month , has been a crushing burden on the shelters .
iglesia cristiana embajadores de jesus , a church situated in a denuded ravine on the western edge of tijuana , was sheltering hundreds of people even though it was not connected to the municipal water supply and had to refill its tanks with a water truck .
claudia portela , coordinator of padre chava , which recently opened a smaller second shelter , estimates that donations have provided for 98 percent of their needs during the crisis .
â€ on a recent morning , she and her colleague , adriana reyna , jumped into ms. reyna â€™ s sport utility vehicle and took a tour of several shelters in tijuana to assess their needs .
at iglesia cristiana embajadores de jesus , the church in the ravine , a haitian girl had fallen .
her parents worried she had fractured a bone .
so the women drove the child and her father to a nearby clinic where they arranged for a free evaluation , then swung by a pharmacy to pick up some medicine to treat the pain and swelling .
with a phone call , the women found a taker : a shelter in central tijuana .
were they being deported ?
â€œ i hope they â€™ ll all be able to cross .
his â€œ america first â€ pledges have raised concerns among diplomats at the united nations about his commitment to international cooperation .
the administration â€™ s antipathy toward the united nations has been sharpened since a security council resolution last month condemning israeli settlements .
that assessed contribution pays for operating expenses like the electricity bills at its headquarters and human rights investigations in places like syria and south sudan .
the united states also contributes voluntarily to other united nations programs , including those that provide food and blankets to refugees fleeing war zones and that immunize children against preventable diseases .
some of the provisions in the draft text are redundant , and it is unclear how serious these proposals are , or if they will ever be signed .
the money that the united states voluntarily contributes to the united nations is a little over 0 .
china also has a veto in the security council .
â€œ this is a time of strength , this is a time of action , this is a time of getting things done , â€ ms. haley said on friday , adding that she was prepared to the united nations â€™ efforts .
that â€™ s possible , and it â€™ s also possible that we won â€™ t .
we will see what happens .
â€ standing at mr. trump â€™ s side , mrs. may warned against easing sanctions unless russia abides by a peace settlement for ukraine negotiated in minsk , the capital of belarus .
for our commander in chief to think otherwise would be naÃ¯ve and dangerous .
mr. trump appeared comfortable and confident with mrs. may standing to his right .
he also tried to reassure europeans who view him with deep skepticism .
â€ â€œ mr .
â€ mr. trump embraced the decision by british voters to exit the european union , a referendum known as â€œ brexit â€ that he and others have seen as a precursor to his own election .
the united states and europe have imposed sanctions on russian officials and companies , mainly in response to the seizure and annexation of crimea and the separatist war fomented in eastern ukraine .
in an interview with the times of london shortly before taking office , mr. trump suggested a bargain that would ease sanctions on russia in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and cooperation in the fight against the islamic state .
â–  the march drew thousands of activists .
kellyanne conway may have sprung onto the national political scene largely unknown .
he said he would announce his choice on thursday to fill the seat left vacant by the death of justice antonin scalia last february .
marchers waved signs spelling out their beliefs in messages like â€œ save the babies , â€ â€œ â€ and â€œ trump for baby bumps .
â€œ everyone should be able to live their life and live it however they want to .
â€ â€œ i want women to have their rights , â€ she added .
â€œ but i think there are a bunch of women in the womb that are being killed , too .
â€œ i feel empowered .
i feel positive .
â€ ''
the choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives â€™ expectations .
white house counselor kellyanne conway spent her time as a pollster and messaging expert before 2016 , advising groups and politicians on how to soften their approach when talking about the issue .
â€ ms. conway is also a featured speaker at friday â€™ s rally in washington , the annual march for life .
women in the movement , like ms. dannenfelser of the susan b. anthony list , once publicly declared themselves â€œ disgusted â€ by him .
â€œ it â€™ s a declaration of cultural war alliance .
â€œ we are cautiously optimistic .
â€ ''
but it is unclear whether that anger will translate into attendance at the march for life .

a trade war bubbling up with mexico .
a ban on refugees from countries .
â€ so , about that week .
â€œ just do what we elected you to do .
we won .
drop the inauguration stuff .
it â€™ s fine .
â€œ but i think this first week is proving he â€™ s capable of following through on that with real action .
â€ but what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents .
the bar at boondocks , where mr. cooperrider dug into a b. l. t. sandwich on a sleety morning , sits about 1 , 900 miles from the arizona deserts where sections of the border wall may rise .
â€œ if he asked me to lay the first brick , i â€™ d sign up .
i â€™ m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us .
there is no agreement on how to pay for a $ 20 billion mexican border wall .
he roughed them out , and his supporters filled in the details .
but it seems to take the press â€™ s mind off what he â€™ s really doing .
â€ ''
ms. may was more direct in her answer to the question about sanctions on russia .
â€ mr. trump appeared to be struggling about the issue even as he spoke , returning several times to his own belief in torture â€™ s effectiveness even as he stated several times that he would let mr. mattis would decide .
â€ then he added : â€œ but i do disagree .
the call suggests that the two leaders may be attempting to reschedule the planned meeting .
he just wants more bang for the buck .
mr. trump is just not going to give up his claim that 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants voted for hillary clinton , but he â€™ s grasping for evidence .
mr. phillips began pressing his case that 3 million illegal votes were cast shortly after election day in november , but pressed repeatedly , mr. phillips has never produced any evidence .
as the debunking site snopes .
â€ and that is not all mr. phillips has asserted .
mr. trump â€™ s fallacious argument that he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million because of illegal immigrant ballots started as the stuff of wonderment and ridicule .
even moderate democrats are alarmed .
please ?
â€” we should wait and see .
mr. trump may yet keep the soiree alive .
â€ but it isn â€™ t .
that is up from 2014 , when 248 were murdered , and in 2013 , when 246 were killed .
of course , in the era of alternative facts , mayor kenney may be spitting in the wind .
5 million people have signed up for insurance or had their coverage automatically renewed .
some in trump â€™ s inner circle - the new york times , new york times , erin mccann,2017-01-28,2017.0,1.0 , , '' donald j. trump spent his first week in office repeating the lie that between three million and five million people had voted illegally in the november election , first to members of congress , then on twitter , then in an abc news interview , then again on twitter on friday , citing an unsubstantiated claim popular in conspiracy circles .
there is no evidence that any of them voted twice .
not really .
and did you call up the people in charge of voting in your old state to tell them to go ahead and take you off their list ?
probably not .
mr. bannon â€™ s case is a little different .
when he voted in november â€™ s election , he did so by absentee ballot in new york , a spokesman for the state board of elections confirmed .
â€œ why is the national park service tweeting out comparison photos ?
â€ during the call , mr. trump also asked the national park service â€™ s acting director , michael t. reynolds , if he could produce further photographic evidence of the size of his inaugural crowd , according to a second person briefed on the jan. 21 telephone call between the two men .
mr. reynolds could not be reached for comment .
that was some crowd .
â€ he also walked mr. muir over to a panoramic picture of the crowd hanging in a hallway in the west wing .

instead , the party was primarily financed and anchored by google .
the event was emblematic of an by google .
google employees overwhelmingly supported mr. obama â€™ s presidential campaigns , and some later took roles in his administration .
eric schmidt , the chairman of alphabet , google â€™ s parent company , advised the obama white house .
and last year , google employees gave $ 1 .
3 million to hillary clinton â€™ s campaign to succeed mr. obama , compared with $ 26 , 000 to the trump campaign , according to federal filings .
most important , google is trying to change the perception that it is a democratic stronghold .
last month , google also posted an opening to fill a position for a â€œ conservative outreach â€ employee in its washington office .
â€œ even though it has reached out to republicans , it can â€™ t shake the image .
the perception is that they lean left and their executives backed mrs. clinton .
â€ google has much at stake as it repositions itself .
during the obama years , google avoided american antitrust charges , even as european regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business .
google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012 .
now warning shots against google have been fired by those in mr. trump â€™ s circle .
in a recent interview with the new york times , peter thiel , a venture capitalist and trump transition adviser , also compared the power that google had under mr. obama to that which the oil giant exxon mobil had under president george w. bush .
they also suspected google was skewing search results in favor of mrs. clinton , said barry bennett , a former senior adviser for mr. trump â€™ s campaign .
â€œ mr .
schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat donald trump , â€ mr. bennett said .
â€œ it takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened .
â€ google has denied it tweaked its search results , which are determined by algorithms , and the company declined to comment on mr. schmidt .
white house officials did not respond to a request for comment .
for many years , google â€™ s support of democrats was plain .
google â€™ s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to mr. obama â€™ s 2012 campaign at $ 804 , 240 , according to the center for responsive politics .
in 2008 , google â€™ s pac and employees were sixth with $ 817 , 855 .
about five years ago , google began diversifying its bets .
in 2011 , google hired stewart jeffries , a former member of the house judiciary committee , to lobby republicans on capitol hill .
google also sponsored conservative think tanks such as the american enterprise institute and the heritage foundation .
the company has hosted republican lawmakers including the house majority leader , kevin mccarthy of california , and darrell issa of california at its headquarters in mountain view , calif. google â€™ s washington office is now roughly split between republican and democrats .
for the first time last year , google â€™ s pac gave more to republican congressional candidates than to democrats , according to the center for responsive politics .
google â€™ s head of global public policy , caroline atkinson , was mr. obama â€™ s former national security adviser .
a former google executive , megan smith , became the nation â€™ s chief technology officer .
during his presidency , mr. obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by google , including net neutrality in 2015 and cable box reforms last year .
since the election , google has accelerated efforts to win over the republican white house and congress .
days after mr. trump â€™ s victory , google also contacted the independent journal review , which it had worked with on events during the republican campaign debates .
google told the news that it would provide the main funding for the party at the smithsonian .

looking at the album , i was struck by how joyful the photos were â€” and by the fact that as fabled as this era was , i had never seen a black family â€™ s own account of that time .
i wondered who these neighbors were , and who had thrown the album out .
i went back to lincoln place , hoping to find the album â€™ s owner it had surely been thrown out by mistake .
or they had been torn down and replaced by big buildings with spotlights and signs .
so i put the album on my bookshelf .
i stumbled upon the album while packing and pulled it off the shelf .
now i really had to reckon with it .
and the album was literally falling apart in my hands .
last spring , i began the search .
the photos were arranged on black pages with little mounting corners and scotch tape that had turned yellow with age .
there were 167 pictures , and they covered both sides of the pages , as if to save space .
but the photos stopped about halfway through the album .
the rest of it was blank .
she had a full figure and elegant hands .
she smoked .
she was often with the same man .
they were embracing , or they were in separate photos on the same page .
â€ carrying photocopies of a few pictures , i went back to crown heights .
there was a retro cocktail bar .
there was a pilates studio .
i showed him the photocopied pictures , and he squinted .
â€œ etta mae .
â€ the man in the pictures was her husband , isaiah taylor .
when i returned to lincoln place a few days later with the whole album , mr. burton and his wife , lenore , were doing a puzzle at a card table .
â€œ i wouldn â€™ t touch it .
i â€™ m amazed you would touch it .
they were in their late 80s .
â€œ now i â€™ m lucky if i know 10 people .
pages had torn loose from the binding , and as we passed them between us , black flakes fluttered to the floor .
â€œ etta and ike .
â€ halfway through , we came to a page crowded with small pictures .
mr. burton paused .
â€œ your mother , uncle fernando â€” that â€™ s my wedding .
â€ i was hooked .
now that i had names , i enlisted a researcher at the new york times , susan c. beachy , and she pulled documents for etta mae taylor : census records birth , death and marriage certificates old phone books newspaper clippings .
etta mae didn â€™ t have children .
her siblings had all died .
she was now in her 70s .
for months , the only other thing i knew about her was that she didn â€™ t pick up her phone .
i didn â€™ t blame her .
â€œ hello , â€ i would say when i left voice mail messages , â€œ i â€™ m calling about a photo album that may have belonged to your family .
when ms. taylor was young , it was a boomtown .
there were portraits of women in flouncy dresses , babies , a boy with a dog , a group in straw hats in a field .
i wondered if they were etta mae â€™ s parents .
her father , james frank barnes , was a grocery store clerk .
when she was still a child , her oldest brother , charles , boarded the train that passed through wilson and became part of what we now call the great migration , the exodus of millions of black southerners from the jim crow south .
in 1940 , etta mae left her crowded home .
his father was a cook .
suffolk , like wilson , was segregated , unofficially divided by the railroad tracks .
there were about a dozen photographs from the war in the album , loose snapshots tucked in the back .
they showed black soldiers amid spindly trees and what looked like japanese shrines .
ike was an army truck commander in the 510th port battalion and rose to the rank of master sergeant , according to his military records .
( it was from tinian that the enola gay took off for hiroshima . )
james w. taylor ( no relation to ike ) died in 2014 .
in the video , he described their time in the army .
their battalion unloaded ammunition from ships and provided transport .
on tinian , they lived apart from the white soldiers .
they slept in tents in a separate camp , ate separately and drank from water tanks that they filled , separately , from a mountain spring .
these men may have enlisted in the army to escape jim crow , but instead they found themselves on a tropical island in the pacific that had become a replica of the segregated south .
this was where records trailed off .
but that was all i had .
â€œ i â€™ ll buzz you in , dear .
she had short gray hair and wore a blouse .
â€œ o .
â€ i held out the album .
i laughed too , with relief .
she invited us in .
her apartment was small and neat .
she had been cleaning , and after she washed her hands , we sat down .
â€œ i always liked this picture .
â€ she shook her head and smiled .
wilson was about an hour â€™ s drive east .
the downtown was deserted , the brick warehouses the only remnant of the tobacco era .
in the empty lot where it once stood , there was no trace of the family that had become so real to me .
a pickup was parked in the overgrown grass .
we met up at an applebee â€™ s off the highway .
â€œ that was kind of the going job at the time .
on weekends , they would go dancing â€” at small clubs and at the blocklong savoy ballroom on lenox avenue , where thousands of couples did the jitterbug .
from the time she was little , ms. barnes would take the train every year to visit the taylors .
like these were some movie stars or something .
â€œ mae thought she was the boss .
â€ the photos speak to the glamour of life in harlem , but they barely hint at its struggles .
i reckon .
i couldn â€™ t figure out where they were taken until a clue cropped up in an old newspaper : ike was listed among the members of the eight chaps social club , a men â€™ s club composed of suffolkians that was hosting a dance in harlem .
seven of the chaps were dead now , but the eighth picked up the phone .
of course he remembered him .
â€ he told me the photos were , indeed , from the club â€™ s dances .
then he answered a question that hadn â€™ t occurred to me , which was why the taylors had such a dazzling record of their social life .
â€ in 1950 , the population of central harlem reached its peak , and began to inch their way into other boroughs .
the eight chaps scattered .
crown heights was predominantly white at the time .
after they got married , the burtons bought the red house next door .
and it took me a moment to step back and see the obvious : during this time , as black people arrived on lincoln place , white families were leaving .
â€œ neighborhoods began to open up because white people were so fearful that they would sell at a loss .
â€ it was a sign of what was coming .
â€ now , he added , everyone was discovering brownstone brooklyn .
â€œ a blue chevy , â€ mr. burton recalled .
they drank cocktails and listened to records .
they loved to laugh .
ms. oliver â€™ s mother was a maid .
â€œ my mom lived in a house with a coal stove .
he was 50 .
after he died , etta mae stopped keeping the album .
she took care of children for working couples , recalled the burtons â€™ daughter , carol burton , 58 .
she took in relatives once or twice , for brief spells , but otherwise lived alone .
i found former residents of lincoln place .
they remembered etta mae , but not as the young woman in the album .
â€œ she always had a small dog .
â€œ she was very deliberate and devoted .
and she always greeted everyone .
â€ the end was swift .
she died there , five long miles from lincoln place , on june 4 , 2011 .
she was 92 .
etta mae â€™ s funeral program ends , â€œ etta lived a full life .
in october , lenore burton died .
in ike â€™ s old office , there was a record player , hundreds of records , and a shelf with glasses and little stirrers , the remnants of his bar .
the closets were stuffed with linens and old clothes .
she was tired from the funeral , and overwhelmed .
she packed up some wedding dishes for her sister , a few pots and pans .
for herself , she took some change from a drawer .
â€œ that â€™ s just me .
i â€™ m not a keeper .
she bagged up the clothes .
she pulled the records off the shelf .
she boxed up etta mae â€™ s books .
a few minutes , or a few hours , passed .
then , just as etta mae had walked past my house so many times before , i walked by hers , picked up her album and carried it home . ''
in sunday â€™ s final , nadal , 30 , will face his longtime rival roger federer , 35 , a nostalgic counterpoint to the women â€™ s championship match between venus williams , 36 , and serena williams , 35 .
dimitrov â€™ s backhand was particularly exposed by nadal â€™ s attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors .
â€œ i â€™ m happy , though , with a lot of things .
it also shows me that i â€™ m in a good way , i â€™ m on the right path .
dimitrov , former player who tumbled to 40th last summer , held firm after nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker .
nadal , a major champion , last reached a grand slam final at the 2014 french open , which he won .
â€œ but here i am , and i feel lucky , and i feel very , very happy .
â€ sunday â€™ s match will be the ninth grand slam final between federer and nadal , and their second here .
that final was also preceded by an epic semifinal for nadal , who needed 5 hours 14 minutes to put away fernando verdasco in five sets .
federer , the no .
17 seed , needed five sets thursday to take his semifinal against wawrinka , but that match was nearly two hours shorter than nadal â€™ s win friday .
nadal has won 23 of 34 matches against federer , and 9 of 11 meetings at grand slam events .
nadal â€™ s 14 grand slam titles is second among active players , behind federer â€™ s 17 .
federer has not won a major tournament since wimbledon in 2012 .

also excluded are pakistan and afghanistan , where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the united states .

the philippine president , rodrigo duterte , signed an executive order this month calling for the full and immediate enforcement of a 2012 law that would give six million women like ms. torreras free contraception and reproductive health services .
â€ but the order was also mr. duterte â€™ s latest jab at the roman catholic church , which wields significant power in the philippines and has fought for years to keep the law from taking effect .
but the law , which took more than 13 years to be passed by congress before being signed into law in 2012 , has yet to fully take effect , a testament to the power of the catholic church , groups and allied lawmakers .

now it has become a proxy war between pope francis and the vatican traditionalists who oppose him , with the battleground being a renaissance palace flanked by jimmy choo and hermÃ¨s storefronts on via dei condotti , rome â€™ s most exclusive street .
the knights ignored them , claiming sovereignty .
this past week , the dispute finally blew up .
fed up , francis took the extraordinary steps of demanding the resignation of the order â€™ s leader â€” a decision the knights officially accepted saturday â€” and announcing that a papal delegate would step in .
now , suddenly , he is more politically isolated .
the knights of malta is a bastion of catholic tradition .
into this volatile situation stepped cardinal burke .
during the summer , as tensions mounted inside the order , michael hichborn , the president of the lepanto institute , a conservative catholic organization in virginia , conducted what he called a â€œ short investigation â€ into the order â€™ s international aid arm , which mr. boeselager oversaw .
a few days later , cardinal burke relayed his concerns about mr. boeselager to francis .
according to supporters of the cardinal , the pope then instructed him to root out from the order elements of freemasonry , vatican shorthand for adherents of a secular moral view .
â€ he argued that once he had discovered the program , he had informed the vatican and it ended .
the pope was already critical of the ornate dress favored by the knights ( red military jacket and gold epaulets ) and by cardinal burke ( a long train of billowing red silk known as a cappa magna ) .
francis also had a history of with the knights during his time as a cardinal in argentina .
( cardinal burke and mr. festing declined to comment . )
â€ the commission ultimately ruled that the pope did have authority over the knights of malta .
on tuesday , he exercised it .
on saturday , they did just that , immediately reinstating mr. boeselager and promising to collaborate with the pope â€™ s delegate .
but supporters of mr. festing were horrified by the vatican â€™ s de facto takeover .

they mostly live in cramped apartments where the rent consumes any humanitarian aid they may receive .
the rest of the refugees , about 8 percent , according to some estimates , live in three refugee camps that offer basic services and are free , but also limit freedom of movement .
the flood of refugees has put a strain on the country â€™ s limited resources , and public clinics in jordan no longer provide free health care to syrians .
nearly a year ago , amnesty international warned that syrian refugees in jordan were unable to get access to health care and other vital services , citing â€œ the combination of grossly inadequate support from the international community and barriers imposed by the government of jordan .

by then , the signs were clear : it was not a simple illness .
nearly everyone in his neighborhood , crumbling under the influx of refugees fleeing the islamist rebels , is skin and bones , starving and slowly dying .
the boy â€™ s father had left the capital of borno state to find a job as a day laborer because there were few jobs in the city .

there were no vacant hospital beds , they told her .
the backyard was strewn with trash , a hole dug in the ground for a toilet .
ms. saleh walked 600 feet to retrieve the family â€™ s drinking water from a well and took home what she could carry in small containers .
they had to save something for breakfast .
by early november , abdulrahman â€™ s health had rapidly declined .
he was always tired and had a fever , no appetite and a stiff neck â€” a sign of deadly meningitis .
but abdulrahman â€™ s health deteriorated .
he died on nov. 15 , another victim in a region plundered by boko haram rebels , who have destroyed houses and schools , kidnapped thousands of young women and forced millions to flee their homes , plunging nigeria into the worst recession in decades .
the rebels have warned that they left behind mines on the fields .
â€œ we only need food , food , food , and nothing else , â€ ms. adam said in an interview in december .

gen. john f. kelly , the secretary of homeland security , had dialed in from a coast guard plane as he headed back to washington from miami .
halfway into the briefing , someone on the call looked up at a television in his office .
in his first week in office , mr. trump signed other executive actions with little or no legal review , but his order barring refugees has had the most explosive implications .
â€ customs and border protection officers were also caught unaware .
they also struggled with how to exercise the waiver authority that was included in the executive order , which allowed the homeland security secretary to let some individuals under the ban enter the country case by case .
he also backpedaled on the policy and said that the executive order â€™ s restrictions on entry to the united states would not apply to legal permanent residents â€œ going forward .
that assertion is likely to do little to calm the public furor , which showed no signs of waning at the beginning of mr. trump â€™ s second full week in the oval office .

and that is exactly what happened .

the immigration ban unleashed chaos on the immigration system and in airports in the united states and overseas , and prompted protests and legal action .
the executive order was signed at 4:42 p. m. eastern on friday .
it does not affect naturalized united states citizens from the seven named countries .
after the order was signed , students , visitors and legal permanent united states residents from the seven countries â€” and refugees from around the world â€” were stopped at airports in the united states and abroad , including cairo , dubai and istanbul .

709,18079 , troops who cleaned up radioactive islands can â€™ t get medical care - the new york times , new york times , dave philipps,2017-02-05,2017.0,2.0 , , '' richland , wash. â€” when tim snider arrived on enewetak atoll in the middle of the pacific ocean to clean up the fallout from dozens of nuclear tests on the ring of coral islands , army officers immediately ordered him to put on a respirator and a bright yellow suit designed to guard against plutonium poisoning .
he spent the rest of his stint on the islands wearing only cutoff shorts and a floppy sun hat .
â€œ it was just propaganda .
like mr. snider , most did not even wear shirts , let alone respirators .
congress long ago recognized that troops were harmed by radiation on enewetak during the original atomic tests , which occurred in the 1950s , and should be cared for and compensated .
the cleanup of enewetak has long been portrayed as a triumph .
records show that protective equipment was missing or unusable .
between 1948 and 1958 , 43 atomic blasts rocked the tiny atoll â€” part of the marshall islands , which sit between hawaii and the philippines â€” obliterating the native groves of breadfruit trees and coconut palms , and leaving an apocalyptic wreckage of twisted test towers , radioactive bunkers and rusting military equipment .
the residents had been evacuated .
in the early 1970s , the enewetak islanders threatened legal action if they didn â€™ t get their home back .
in 1972 , the united states government agreed to return the atoll and vowed to clean it up first , a project shared by the atomic energy commission , now called the department of energy , and the department of defense .
the biggest problem , according to energy department reports , was runit island , a spit of sand blitzed by 11 nuclear tests in 1958 .
the military initially quarantined runit .
government scientists agreed that other islands might be made habitable , but runit would most likely forever be too toxic , memos show .
so federal officials decided to collect radioactive debris from the other islands and dump it into the runit crater , then cap it with a thick concrete dome .
but without adequate funding , simple precautions were scrapped .
then a bulldozer driver , he began scraping topsoil that records show contained plutonium .
â€œ that dust was like baby powder .
we were covered in it , â€ said mr. laird , now 60 , during an interview in rural maine , where he owns a small auto repair shop .
â€ by the time mr. laird left the islands , he was throwing up and had a blisterlike rash .
a scan at the hospital showed he also had bladder cancer .
he applied repeatedly for free veterans â€™ health care for radiation but was denied .
according to an energy department memo , in 1978 , only a third of the samplers were working .
all troops were issued a small film badge to measure radiation exposure , but government memos note that humid conditions destroyed the film .
failure rates often reached 100 percent .
in 1988 , congress passed a law providing automatic medical care to any troops involved in the original atomic testing .
but the act covers veterans only up to 1958 , when atomic testing stopped , excluding the enewetak cleanup crews .
veterans don â€™ t have that right .
a 1950 supreme court ruling bars troops and their families from suing for injuries arising from military service .
it nearly always denies coverage .
unpaid medical bills left him $ 100 , 000 in debt .

her nipples lack any feeling .
she can not sense the slightest touch of her breasts , perceive warmth or cold , feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door .
but they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms .
â€œ it does raise the question : who is breast reconstruction for ? â€ adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations , particularly â€œ â€ mastectomies .
during a traditional mastectomy , doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue , causing considerable nerve damage .
but now , in certain cases , the nipple can be spared , raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved .
â€œ i thought that because i was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply , i â€™ d keep my feeling .
several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood .

democrats , meanwhile , hailed ms. yates as a principled defender of what she thought was right .
mr. boente was as united states attorney and , though the situation is unprecedented , the white house said he was authorized to sign the warrants .
by the time she had landed in turkey , however , mr. trump had signed his executive order halting entrance to the united states of all syrian refugees and of most citizens from seven predominantly muslim countries .
mrs. may was beginning to feel the backlash .
she was accused of appeasement by a former british diplomat .
5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that mrs. may rescind her invitation for mr. trump to visit queen elizabeth ii .
while mrs. may is the latest prominent figure to suffer repercussions for her handling of mr. trump , the leaders of those other three close allies have also felt the sting of public anger soon after what seemed to be friendly telephone calls or encounters .
in a telephone call on saturday , she reminded him of washington â€™ s obligations under the geneva conventions to accept refugees fleeing war , a view underlined by her official spokesman .
â€œ the problem for may is that trump doesn â€™ t value relationships .
â€œ you can show up at his doorstep and hold his hand so he doesn â€™ t fall down a ramp , but that doesn â€™ t mean a few hours later when he â€™ s signing an order he thinks at all about how it affects you , your politics or your citizens , â€ mr. shapiro said .

but in such a short time , the movement has proved unusually adept .

protesters at the women â€™ s march had pink woolen hats with cat ears â€” â€œ pussy hats , â€ a reference to the president â€™ s confessed penchant for grabbing things .
there â€™ s money , too .

millions might lose health care coverage if he repeals the affordable care act .

726,18119 , quebec mosque attack forces canadians to confront a strain of intolerance - the new york times , new york times , ian austen and craig s. smith,2017-02-24,2017.0,2.0 , , '' quebec â€” in a world often hostile to migration , canada has stood out , welcoming thousands of refugees fleeing war and seeking a haven .
it has been a time for canada , proud of its national tolerance .
on sunday , that was upended when a man walked into a mosque and started shooting , killing six people and wounding eight .
the nation quickly rallied after the attack .
but the attack also forced canadians to confront a growing intolerance and extremism that has taken root particularly among some people in this corner of the country .

â€ mr. bissonnette , 27 , who was also charged with five counts of attempted murder , appeared at the quebec city courthouse looking boyish in a white jumpsuit .
the shooting was the first time anyone had been killed in a mosque in canada in such circumstances and was , at least in recent times , a rare event outside the muslim world .
until sunday there had not been any murders in the city for 21 months .
he was a student of anthropology and political science at laval university , just minutes from where the shooting took place , according to people who monitored his online activities .
mr. bissonnette and his family live in a western suburb of quebec city that lies in the shadow of a towering railroad trestle .
â€ even outspoken critics of the religion recoiled at the prospect that an increasingly acrimonious debate over rising islamic immigration may have contributed to the violence .

it is emblematic of mr. trump â€™ s trust on a range of political and ideological issues .
but his stated preference for blowing things up â€” as opposed to putting them back together â€” may not translate to his new role .
mr. flynn replied it was saturday â€” he had delayed it to fit in mrs. may â€™ s meeting for â€œ protocol â€ as a united states ally , adding at length that mr. putin was impatient to chat .
still , the episode that did the most damage to the relationship occurred in early december when mr. flynn â€™ s son , also named michael , unleashed a series of tweets pushing a discredited conspiracy theory that clinton associates had run a child ring out of a washington pizza restaurant .
he was urged to skip it by trump allies , and ultimately agreed .

â€ if he â€™ s bothered by the blowback , mr. spicer , 45 , who had long dreamed of standing behind the white house lectern , is not showing it .
â€œ but the press doesn â€™ t like it when you call out their errors the same way they call out everyone else â€™ s .
k. you â€™ re all liars .
â€™ â€ over a conversation , mr. spicer â€” who ate ice cream from a cup branded with the presidential seal â€” was by turns defensive and relaxed , and still excited by the novelty of working in the west wing .
a framed photograph of himself at the white house lectern , taken days earlier , was displayed on a mantel .
a note from barack obama â€™ s press secretary , josh earnest , was nearby .
â€œ that â€™ s a huge thing .
â€œ he talks for a living .
â€œ but he hung in there .
â€ mr. bannon , the former chairman of breitbart news , rarely speaks to reporters on the record .
but he reached out to a reporter unprompted to praise mr. spicer after learning of this profile , a sign of the trump white house â€™ s support for mr. spicer after a tumultuous first week .
mr. trump criticized mr. spicer â€™ s initial fiery appearance in the white house briefing room , urging him to wear a sharper suit and appear more confident , according to a person with knowledge of the conversations .
â€ â€œ sean spicer is much too polite to the media , â€ mr. bannon added .
â€ ( he was referring to a proposal , scrapped for now , to move the white house briefing room from its current west wing home . )
â€ finishing his ice cream â€” which was not â€” mr. spicer shrugged .
â€œ you â€™ re not here to be someone â€™ s buddy .
â€œ and if you think it â€™ s going to be anything bad , then this isn â€™ t the job for you .
â€œ i don â€™ t feel like a settler .
we have to go big , bold and fast .
they fear ma â€™ ale adumim will be just the beginning of the annexation of settlements in the west bank , now home to roughly 400 , 000 jews , and the end of the dream .
â€œ i â€™ m fed up .
â€ there are signs , in fact , that the conflict here is already shifting , with ma â€™ ale adumim near the center , no matter how quiet and workaday its residents think themselves ( 70 percent of residents commute to jerusalem proper for their jobs ) .
you can see there â€” the desert , rocks and sand .
now you have a living city .
but here , scrutiny has been intense on ma â€™ ale adumim .
it is partly symbolic : israel has not annexed 1967 land beyond east jerusalem and the golan heights .
â€ it is partly strategic : the settlement is at the heart of entrenched plans to expand jerusalem , linking it to the city proper , along with other nearby settlements that also function in practice as jerusalem suburbs .
more of their makeshift housing has been torn down and land for their goats and sheep â€” they sell meat , yogurt and cheese to survive â€” declared .
a palestinian flag was recently planted in a park in ma â€™ ale adumim here , a worrying sign for residents that the less expensive , less harried life in their suburb may change .

these apologies are easy and usually readily accepted , often with a response like , â€œ no problem .
my relief was palpable .
the offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression .
forgiveness , should it come , may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated .
it â€™ s very difficult to take direct , unequivocal responsibility for our hurtful actions .
it takes a great deal of maturity to put a relationship or another person before our need to be right .
there â€™ s no guarantee as to how it will be received .
righting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members , who may be inclined to cite history â€” he was abused by his father , or she was raised by a distant mother â€” as an excuse for hurtful behavior .
â€ she urges the listener not to â€œ interrupt , argue , refute , or correct facts , or bring up your own criticisms and complaints .
dr. lerner views apology as â€œ central to health , both physical and emotional .
an apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it â€” blood pressure decreases , heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier .

some of those options , like pushing more authority to conduct strikes to commanders in the field or loosening restrictions designed to limit the risk to civilians , could also be applied to attacks against qaeda fighters and islamic state insurgents .
he did not want to be identified because he feared that speaking out would endanger his life .
all of those plots were thwarted .

nadal ended last season early , too , after an injury to his left wrist .
with the match in his grasp , nadal wavered while federer let his elegant strokes fly .
the spaniard required 4 hours 56 minutes to beat federer â€™ s stylistic acolyte , grigor dimitrov , and his backhand in the semifinals .
federer â€™ s decision to take a timeout again on sunday drew criticism from the former wimbledon champion pat cash of australia , who said on bbc radio that it was â€œ legal cheating â€ to interrupt a long match because of weariness .
i â€™ m the last guy to call a medical timeout .
but with his chances appearing to fade , federer took control , breaking nadal â€™ s serve in the long and edgy sixth and eighth games of the set .
the review upheld the initial call , and federer pumped his arms over his head and leapt with delight .
â€œ nevertheless , emotions poured out of me .
i was incredibly happy .
â€œ for me , it â€™ s all about the comeback , about an epic match with rafa again .

with the prospect of peace on the horizon , i was determined to visit before it became a major tourist destination .
so back in april 2000 , after some nimble arranging , i traveled across syria for a week and returned to israel satisfied with my journey .
and then as i was stationed in other countries and on other continents , the trip to syria faded into background .
then in 2016 , the trip flooded back as the syrian civil war unleashed its fury on aleppo , my favorite of the cities i visited .
i was seized with a fever to remember more .
it was humid , rainy and hot .
but my mind kept returning to that trip long ago .
when it arrived in the mail , i opened to the introduction and read a passage that is now cruelly out of date : â€œ along with jordan , â€ syria is â€œ probably the single most safe country for travelers in the whole of the region .
â€ as i paged through the guidebook , details started to return .
i flew from tel aviv to amman and prepared to enter syria with my tourist passport .
it was not really a taxi â€” just a driver and his car , a version of uberpool .
but the driver spoke a little english and confirmed that he was leaving for damascus right away .
that was enough for me .
i crammed inside with three other men , and we left amman .
the driver and the other passengers , who seemed to know each other , loaded the trunk with boxes .
we started up again , heading for the border .
evening turned to night .
wedged between silent men in the back of the car , my thoughts kept returning to those boxes in the trunk .
had i somehow chosen a smuggler â€™ s car for my crossing into syria ?
luckily , i did not .
instead , i took out a package of fig newtons , bought at the american embassy commissary in tel aviv .
perhaps they just needed sugar .
smiles flashed in the darkness , the radio was turned up , and arabic filled the car , interspersed with the words â€œ fig newton .
he reached for my hand , held it tight , and we walked together like that to the syrian border .
men holding hands in a demonstration of friendship was common during my time in the middle east , but it was new to me .
i heard â€œ fig newton â€ in the middle of a stream of arabic .
they stamped our passports , and we were through .
it was after midnight when we arrived in damascus .
the city was quiet , as was the car â€” we had all become sleepy .
we waved silent goodbyes .
i left them the package of cookies , walked to a small hotel and passed out on the thin mattress .
i bought souvenirs .
i ate frozen ice and watched the groaning water wheels in the city of hama .
there was more to see , and i vowed to return .
on the way back to jordan , i took an bus and avoided the drama of my entry .
in recent months , i finally found the box containing mementos and letters from that era , and discovered a brass door knocker bought in a damascus antique shop .
it is in the shape of a hand with long , elegant fingers clenching what appears to be a pomegranate .
other memories appeared in vivid bursts .
they even covered his desk .
then i remembered the oud .
as i held it in my arms i suddenly could picture the store in aleppo where i bought it .
we spoke in halting french .
he looked crestfallen , so i quickly agreed to the original price .
then i left .
the encounter took maybe five minutes .
now it sits in our apartment in chicago .
something like this happened once to my father .
he leaned back in his chair and sank into himself for a minute .
â€ he was talking about the rain splattering into the soil , humus lifting up in waves from the ground .
it clings to me , mostly forgotten , but once in a while it asserts its presence .
the result is an upswelling of memory so strong that it feels like time travel .
memories of travel can linger for a lifetime .
most of all , they are a gift we give to ourselves â€” a transfer of spirit from our younger , versions to the people we are right now . ''
we couldn â€™ t hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper .
i found that , true enough , with no job , no friends and no television , a lot of writing is possible .
â€œ oh , there â€™ s another author round here whose baby i just delivered .
â€ loneliness and prideful smugness did battle : an unspoken obligation loomed .
the author in question turned out to be owen sheers .
so much of contemporary cultural production and consumption takes place in urban settings , and , globally , the pace of urbanization is accelerating .
i suggested a writers â€™ book club to discuss a different book every month from the perspective of craft , technique , style .
and their enthusiasm for the book club was palpable .
we were explicitly gathered not to talk about ourselves , but about books .
now each month we assemble like a clandestine congregation of nonconformists in the basement of a charming local pub : the bridge end inn , talgarth .
after several months , we quickly overwhelmed our allotted table and colonized the whole room .
our membership is now pushing 18 .
the main factor , we â€™ d all agree , is the cost of time .
money vaporizes in london before you â€™ ve even put your hand in your pocket .
away from the city , climate change as a totalizing political and cultural concern is hard to avoid .
lately , we have spent time talking , as all writers do , about the inadequacy of language of the need for a new vocabulary to describe things that humans have denatured , violated .
the sea is no longer the same sea that the word initially signified .
pretentious perhaps , but urgent too .
nope , not her .
she had a loving partner , michael , by her side .
that was just us .
â€ ms. fludgate retreated to her apartment , sitting at times in the dark , leaving her solitude only when her cats needed food .
as her savings dwindled , ms. fludgate resorted to selling items like furniture and jewelry on ebay .
â€œ i had a great job at a university .
and then my life just fell apart .
she currently receives $ 1 , 570 a month in social security , $ 154 in food stamps and a small stipend from a job as a counselor for seniors , a job that ends this week .
it secured a $ 1 , 000 grant in neediest cases funds to allow ms. fludgate to buy a sofa , a chair and a console table .
but she worries she is at the age where landing a job may be impossible .

he noted that the senate confirmed judge gorsuch without opposition in 2006 to his current seat on the united states court of appeals for the 10th circuit .
â€ if confirmed , judge gorsuch would become the 113th justice and take a seat held not only by justice scalia , but also by justice robert h. jackson , perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court .
as an episcopalian , judge gorsuch would be the only protestant seated among five catholics and three jewish jurists .
he also praised justice scalia as â€œ a lion of the law .
â€ the announcement reopened the bitter wounds that dominated the political battle last year over mr. obama â€™ s nominee for the seat , judge merrick b. garland .
a colorado native who was in the same class at harvard law school as mr. obama , judge gorsuch is known for his measured opinions that are normally , though not exclusively , conservative .
he holds a doctorate from oxford university , where he was a marshall scholar , and was a supreme court law clerk to justices byron r. white and kennedy .
that judge gorsuch has a personal connection to justice kennedy is no accident .
and he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than the legislature to achieve policy goals .
the white house stoked suspense over mr. trump â€™ s court choice in the hours before announcing it .
nan aron of the alliance for justice called judge gorsuch â€œ a disastrous choice , â€ adding that his record showed â€œ no sign that he would offer an independent check on the dangerous impulses of this administration .
â€ ''
i am a man of my word .
today .
.. ( applause ) thank you .
today i am keeping another promise to the american people by nominating judge neil gorsuch of the united states supreme court to be of the united states supreme court .
and i would like to ask judge gorsuch and his wonderful wife , louise , to please step forward â€” please , louise , judge .
was it ?
i took the task of this nomination very seriously .
when he was nominated to the 10th circuit court of appeals , he was confirmed by the senate unanimously .
also â€” that â€™ s unanimous , can you believe that ?
( applause ) does that happen anymore ?
does it happen ?
maybe it will .
also with us tonight is maureen scalia , a woman loved by her husband and deeply respected by all .
i am so happy she â€™ s with us .
where is maureen ?
please , stand up .
thank you , maureen .
( applause ) thank you , maureen .
he then received his law degree from harvard , also with honors , where he was a truman scholar .
after law school , he clerked on the supreme court for both justices byron white and anthony kennedy .
it is an extraordinary rÃ©sumÃ© .
the qualifications of judge gorsuch are beyond dispute .
may god bless you , may god bless our glorious nation .
judge gorsuch , the podium , sir , is yours .
( applause ) gorsuch : thank you .
for the last decade , i â€™ ve worked as a federal judge in a court that spans six western states , serving about 20 percent of the continental united states and about 18 million people .
i think of them tonight .
justice scalia was a lion of the law .
agree or disagree with him , all of his colleagues on the bench shared his wisdom and his humor .
and like them , i miss him .
i am forever grateful .
thank you .
a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge .

the nominee must fill out an elaborate questionnaire , which the senate will examine .
the questionnaire often runs hundreds of pages long .
the f. b. i. will immediately begin a background check , and the staff members of senators on the judiciary committee will start their own investigations .
there will most likely be political jostling over how the confirmation hearing is conducted .
â€ justice kagan called them a â€œ vapid and hollow charade .
at least a week after the hearings , the committee will vote on sending the nomination to the full senate .
a simple majority is needed , but there â€™ s a twist : by tradition , supreme court nominations are sent to the senate even if the nominee is rejected by the committee .
furious republicans vowed that democrats would regret it once control of the senate flipped .
mr. mcconnell was among those who condemned the tactic at the time .
justice antonin scalia , he was told , had died .
he spent part of his childhood in washington and practiced law here for a decade , at a prominent law firm and in the justice department .
â€œ and that document isn â€™ t some inkblot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams .
the supreme court ruled in favor of hobby lobby in 2014 and vacated the decision concerning the little sisters of the poor in 2016 .
like justice scalia , judge gorsuch takes a broad view of the fourth amendment , which bars unreasonable government searches and seizures .
judge gorsuch was born and spent his early years in colorado , and he returned there when he became a judge more than a decade ago .
â€œ there are so many cases that have to do with the west , and i also think the cultural sensibilities of the west are different .
â€ in colorado , judge gorsuch is known for his involvement with the outdoors and the local legal community .
he lives in unincorporated boulder county , in a community on a property with several horses .
he has raised chickens and goats with his teenage daughters , emma and belinda , and his wife , louise , an avid equestrian .
he is a black diamond skier and fisherman and hosts regular picnics for his former law clerks with another 10th circuit judge , timothy m. tymkovich .
he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than legislatures to achieve their policy goals , and has called for limiting the power of federal regulators .
â€ like justice scalia , judge gorsuch is a lively and accessible writer .
â€œ the answer is no .
while the statement may cause you a world of trouble , while it may not be precisely true , it is substantially true .
and that is enough to call an end to this litigation as a matter of law .
ms. gorsuch , known after her remarriage as anne burford , resigned under fire from congress after 22 months .
after law school , he also attended oxford university in england as a marshall scholar , graduating with a doctorate in legal philosophy .
the book argued that laws banning those practices should be retained .
if he is confirmed , judge gorsuch will become the 113th justice , taking a seat that has been held not only by justice scalia but also by justice robert h. jackson , perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court .
â€ but judge gorsuch seemed to take special pleasure in remembering the justice who had first hired him as a law clerk , a westerner whose accomplishments were not limited to the law .

and it is not over yet .
â€ foreign travelers inject nearly $ 250 billion into the american economy , the letter said , supporting more than one million jobs .
the diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could , but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from , he was not sure how many would actually sign it .
he said dissent memos were reserved for major policy issues , not for little grumbles like bad food in the embassy cafeteria .
state department rules are supposed to protect dissenters from being retaliated against , and last year several dozen diplomats signed a dissent memo criticizing american policy on syria .

on monday , the divide only widened .
and not everyone behaved predictably .

last week , statistics canada reported that by 2036 , nearly half of all canadians would be immigrants or the children of immigrants â€” most of them what the country calls â€œ visible minorities , â€ which means nonwhite .
that rapid transformation is stirring the most conservative elements of the white canadian population , who see the country as their own , despite the fact that europeans took the land from a patchwork of indigenous peoples who had long existed there .
there are at least 100 extremist groups in canada , according to two canadian studies published last year , with most of them active in the provinces of ontario , quebec , alberta and british columbia .
in 2014 , the last year for which statistics are available , canadian police forces recorded 99 religiously motivated hate crimes against muslims â€” up from 45 in 2012 , according to statistics canada .
a federal court ruled that the provisions did not violate freedom of expression , but they have not been reinstated .

handbills , posters and occasional demonstrations by such groups as the fÃ©dÃ©ration des quÃ©bÃ©cois de souche ( which translates roughly as â€œ people of original quÃ©bÃ©cois stock â€ ) have proliferated in the city .
at the other end of the scale are followers of lÃ©gitime violence , a proudly fascist heavy metal band that announces its concerts to a vetted list of fans and performs songs like â€œ final solution , â€ which is as subtle as it sounds .

sham , now 1Â½ , was born without an eye and with a seriously disfigured face .
it is also a small but striking example of the broader crisis highlighted in a united nations report issued on tuesday showing that the children most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by mr. trump â€™ s order .
sham â€™ s parents left syria and their jobs as teachers in 2013 .
they traveled with their three children to lebanon and then egypt .

â€œ after she was born , we forgot about food , our problems , ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for sham , to see how we could possibly care for this child .
entering spain , however , also proved a struggle .
in june 2016 , the spanish government granted sham â€™ s family permission to travel to barcelona , shortly after the new york times published an article about the infant â€™ s plight and spain â€™ s refusal to grant visas to the whole family .
even before mr. trump â€™ s executive order to bar citizens of some countries from entering the united states , on security grounds , many european governments were dragging their feet in meeting their own commitments to welcome more refugees , following a european union agreement reached in september 2015 .

mr. fillon , a former prime minister , won primary elections in november to become the candidate for the republicans party .
but the allegations have seriously damaged his presidential bid , and the french media , which until last week portrayed him as the favorite , is now openly wondering who might replace him if he drops out of the race .
the allegations are especially damaging for mr. fillon because he has pledged to reduce wasteful spending and has fashioned himself as a stern and honest politician , untouched by the corruption scandals that have plagued some of his opponents .
under french law , it is not illegal for members of parliament to hire relatives as aides , provided that the work is genuine .
others suggested the opposite .

below are notable excerpts .
23 billion daily active users in december . )
snap noted that other countries may choose to censor snapchat .
7 billion at the end of last year .
6 million and included $ 503 , 205 in base salary , a $ 1 million bonus and $ 901 , 635 in other compensation that covered his $ 890 , 339 personal security budget .
1 million .
snap noted that it hired a law firm that employs mr. spiegel â€™ s father .
among them are investment firms like benchmark capital , which owns about 13 percent of the company .
the filing will show how snap is doing as a business and whether that justifies a public valuation of $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion , which the company has been reported to be seeking .
mr. spiegel grew up in pacific palisades , a wealthy los angeles suburb , and attended crossroads , a prep school in santa monica that counts jonah hill , kate hudson and jack black as alumni .
he lived a privileged life , with expensive cars , exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations , according to records from his parents â€™ divorce proceedings .
and life isn â€™ t fair .
â€ at stanford , also his father â€™ s alma mater , mr. spiegel majored in product design and started a handful of companies with mr. murphy , a fellow kappa sigma fraternity brother .
( their early flopped . )
there , mr. spiegel also met some of the men who would become his mentors , including scott cook , then the chief executive of intuit , and eric schmidt , the google chairman , who taught an m. b .
a. class that he attended .
mr. spiegel â€œ really is the next gates or zuckerberg , â€ mr. schmidt said in an interview , comparing the snap chief to microsoft â€™ s bill gates , and facebook â€™ s chief , mark zuckerberg .
â€ when snapchat started taking off , mr. spiegel did not wait to graduate from stanford .
the perception of a divide with silicon valley was also fostered by mr. spiegel â€™ s rejection of a $ 3 billion acquisition offer from facebook in 2013 .
some who met mr. spiegel during snapchat â€™ s early days at stanford describe him as akin to the villain of a 1980s teen movie .
in los angeles , mr. spiegel has shown interest in the city â€™ s fashion , art and music scene .
and he once toyed with the idea of owning a record label with ties to snapchat , according to a 2015 email between sony executives that was released by hackers .
â€ mr. spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations .
â€ last fall , mr. spiegel also attended a private dinner with john o. brennan , then the director of the c. i .
a .
according to multiple attendees , mr. spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of mayor eric garcetti of los angeles .
mr. spiegel â€™ s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered snap .
investors who buy into snap â€™ s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach .
quoting john f. kennedy , he added , â€œ conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth .
â€ ''
he didn â€™ t care .
he was going to america .
now his worst fears are shaping up .
â€ that â€™ s a dangerous tag in a poorly policed refugee camp crawling with islamic militants .
it â€™ s called america .
the united states runs a vigorous resettlement program , taking in thousands of somalis each year .
they were supposed to be walking the streets of atlanta , buffalo , des moines and st. louis by now .
somali women in full veils lay on the sidewalk on their backs .
the men spoke of â€œ the stress .
the brothers had just cleared the final medical checks to be resettled in rhode island .
ahmed hassan , the eldest , a quiet man with a red pen in his pocket , spoke proudly of how in recent days they had been â€œ trained â€ to wear jackets , hats and gloves when it was cold .
others in the pipeline will be put on what the state department calls indefinite hold .
when this was announced at the transit center on saturday at a meeting in the yard , several men cried .
ms. shalala , in an interview on thursday , acknowledged the difficulties .
still , both mr. clinton and ms. shalala , who also cited concerns in keeping talent , expressed optimism .
the organization has also considered scaling back other efforts , according to several people familiar with the discussions , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
the foundation was formed in 1997 during mr. clinton â€™ s presidency and has raised roughly $ 2 billion since then .
for the moment , hiring appears muted : most of the job postings on the foundation â€™ s website are for food service and catering jobs at the clinton presidential center in little rock , ark .
but others saw obstacles ahead .
â€ in 2015 , the charity â€™ s revenues were nearly $ 300 million , down from $ 338 million in 2014 , according to its annual report .
internal goals of raising $ 20 million in unrestricted funds in 2016 were surpassed , but â€œ took a lot of effort to get there , â€ she said .
it held its final meeting in september .
â€œ knowing what to do in this climate is a tough call .
but when he returned to the yangon airport on sunday from a trip to indonesia , cradling his young grandson in his arms as he waited for a taxi , a man drew a pistol and shot him in the head .
the police have not announced a motive for the killing .
but he was hardly a firebrand .
while he did not hesitate to advocate the legal rights of muslims and other minorities whenever he felt they were threatened , he did not promote islamic law and he backed a decision by the national league for democracy not to field muslim candidates in the 2015 election , telling a reporter at the time that it was not worth it given the polarized political climate .
some lawyers wondered how the gunman had acquired a pistol , which is manufactured by the myanmar army , in a country where civilian firearm sales have been prohibited for decades .
a canny constitutional lawyer , mr. ko ni had outmaneuvered the military before .
richard horsey , a political analyst and former united nations official in yangon , called the move a legal â€œ fudge â€ that may have survived because ms. aung san suu kyi â€™ s party controlled the courts .
the veto is actually two parts : a quota that allocates a quarter of the seats in parliament to the military , and the requirement of a 75 percent majority to pass a constitutional amendment .
the bill could be passed with a simple majority , which the national league for democracy could easily muster .

what katyal did not mention â€” and the page did not disclose in his bio â€” is that he has cases pending before the supreme court .
so i don â€™ t blame the writer or the editor in this case .
he also thought it was obvious to the times that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the supreme court , he would have a case before it .
katyal , in his original submission to editors , disclosed that he is a highly experienced litigator before the supreme court .
the editors did not disclose that to readers .
the times editors â€™ lack of disclosure may leave katyal open to unwarranted criticism , not only from readers but from others looking to challenge his motives .
i seriously doubt that he is .
but the times opens itself up to that criticism by failing to simply tell the readers more about who he is .
whenever that happens , the author of the piece is bound to endure scrutiny by those who feel betrayed .
shouldn â€™ t the times err on the side of disclosure ?
it doesn â€™ t need to be in language that implies a grave conflict .
i â€™ m not suggesting that the times should have listed every case katyal has before the court .
but at minimum , readers in this case deserve to know that he is a supreme court litigator with cases before the court .

but nearly every day , stacey , then 24 , smoked marijuana .
with her fiancÃ© â€™ s blessing , she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop .
when sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her shifts , she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break .
often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants .
thc can also be present in breast milk .
young were particularly likely to turn to marijuana : roughly 7 .
â€œ those are important for regulation of emotions and reward , even motor function and cognition .
â€ â€œ you could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana , â€ she added .
â€ some of the gathering evidence is reassuring .
â€œ we need to do a whole lot more research now .
( researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies . )
and pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself .
few realize that thc is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother â€™ s body for weeks , if not months .
to find out whether that â€™ s happening , dr. judy chang , an at the university of pittsburgh , and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients .
pregnant women aren â€™ t eager to discuss it , either , because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture .
but the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now .
she has embraced a persona as an outcast of sorts by labeling herself as mother monster and her fans as little monsters .

when the red hot chili peppers admitted to not having played their instruments live it qualified as a notable event .

it â€™ s not pornographic , it â€™ s not immoral , it â€™ s not racist .
â€ advertisers pay millions of dollars for commercial space during the game , but the network and the national football league maintain the right to approve any ad .
budweiser , for instance , has gained notice it wasn â€™ t anticipating for its super bowl ad .
the commercial , which was released online this week and has passed two million views on youtube , recounts how the brewery â€™ s immigrated to the united states from germany in the 1800s and notes the discrimination he overcame .

so are the patriots â€™ owner , robert kraft , and coach bill belichick .
they are quick to assert their bipartisan or apolitical bona fides .
( â€œ there â€™ d be a putting green on the white house lawn , â€ he predicted . )
brady , whose makeshift podium on the minute maid field on monday night was swarmed with a few hundred reporters , was the central battlefield of incoming questions .
he countered with his most anodyne deflections .
other atlanta falcons and patriots players were also invited to weigh in on political matter but mostly demurred .
â€ and really , was that so distracting ?

perhaps it was a rhetorical question .
to call â€œ i am not your negro â€ a movie about james baldwin would be to understate mr. peck â€™ s achievement .
in his skinny tie and narrow suit , an omnipresent cigarette between his fingers , he imports a touch of midcentury intellectual cool into our overheated , media moment .
in that exchange , as in a speech for an audience of british university students , you are aware of baldwin â€™ s profound weariness .
he must explain himself â€” and also his country â€” again and again , with what must have been sorely tested patience .
â€œ i am not your negro â€ reproduces and redoubles this effect .
at the end of the movie , you are convinced that you know him .
to read baldwin is to be read by him , to feel the glow of his affection , the sting of his scorn , the weight of his disappointment , the gift of his trust .
but he was also a prophet , able to see the truths revealed by the contingent , complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict .
it is not an easy or a consoling movie , but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing .
â€œ i â€™ m forced to be an optimist .

827,18229 , riccardo tisci leaves givenchy : what it means - the new york times , new york times , vanessa friedman,2017-02-03,2017.0,2.0 , , '' yet another seismic shift is taking place in french fashion .
a successor has not been announced .
that he was willing to end what appeared to be a happy marriage suggests that the old days of designers staying in place for decades ( karl lagerfeld has been at chanel since 1983 ) may be finally , officially , over .
â€ and mr. tisci was a upstart italian with a gothic sensibility who had barely started his own line .
mr. tisci was also an early adopter of social media , cognizant of the power that those platforms and influencers would have on fashion .
he has 1 .
8 million followers on instagram , and many of his famous friends appear in his posts as often as they do in the front row of his shows .
so , why leave ?
â€ but rumors have suggested he may be headed to versace .
it would mean going home to italy , and to a brand whose unabashed italian sex and aesthetic mirrors his own .
) .
perhaps this is the answer .
once upon a time , a designer â€™ s name was on the door , and his or her heart was in building a legacy .
now it is rare that any creatives start their own line .
rather , the biggest jobs involve putting their talents at the service of someone else â€™ s already gilded name .
that may be an interesting intellectual and creative challenge for a while , but once achieved , it no longer holds the same allure , and the search for the next test begins .
but what mr. tisci â€™ s move suggests â€” what all of this may reveal â€” is another , more parochial , truth : being a designer is a job like any other .
at the time , it seemed like a radical idea .
it does not any more . ''
up on the screen !
it â€™ s a mystery !
it â€™ s a sitcom !
oh , and it â€™ s a superhero show !
as the titans marvel and dc , having already colonized movie theaters , take over ever larger chunks of television and streaming video , they â€™ ve wisely started to mix things up .
â€ perhaps the least superheroish superhero show , though , is nbc â€™ s new â€œ powerless â€ ( beginning thursday ) .
â€ ( a promo for the show is narrated by that batman , adam west . )
and it â€™ s set in a particularly nonheroic corner of the dc universe : the drab offices of wayne security , where a cousin of batman oversees a motley crew designing products that keep civilians from becoming collateral damage in superhero battles .
it â€™ s a nifty , layered premise .
in the pilot , costumed heroes appear only in the amusing credits sequence and in an opening on an elevated train that plays like an â€™ scene from a hollywood musical .
add a few songs , and it could be from â€œ meet me in st. louis , â€ except for the supervillain tearing up the train tracks and the superhero â€” an actual dc character , crimson fox â€” who saves the day .
â€œ powerless â€ is a cute idea for a show , but it will need a lot more scenes like that to turn into a worthwhile series . ''
and , oh , the stench .
the parisian innovation was spurred by a problem of public urination so endemic that city hall recently proposed dispatching a nearly â€œ incivility brigade â€ of officers to try to prevent bad behavior , which also includes leaving dog waste on the street and littering cigarette butts .
and dozens of surfaces are splattered by urine , according to city hall .
â€œ everyone is tired of the mess .
he had also had inquiries from local councils in cannes , france lausanne , switzerland london and saarbrÃ¼cken , germany .
cleaning up wastes water , and detergents are damaging for the environment .
in chester , northwest england , the local government has clamped down on public urination amid concerns it was damaging the city â€™ s medieval covered walkways .
in france , the acrid smell of urine has been a particular blight on the nation â€™ s capital stretching back centuries , and mr. lebot noted that the carbon of the straw had the added benefit of combating the odor of urine .
in 2006 , he was fined about $ 230 , 000 after he attacked the artwork a second time . ''
once there he set up an early incarnation of yi hap shipyard , a builder of wooden junks , which symbolize the delta and the maritime culture that drove china â€™ s early growth .
3 million to build .
it was commissioned by a restaurant group in hong kong , which lies about 50 miles east of shenwan on the edge of the delta where the river â€™ s silty water turns ocean blue .
also in hong kong is the dukling , a classic , junk that dates from 1955 .
it sank once and was recently refurbished .
the pirate cheung po tsai , or cheung po â€œ the kid , â€ who crisscrossed the delta pillaging and later joined the qing dynasty imperial navy , sailed a ship that looked similar to his namesakes , though its sails may have been a yellow woven bamboo , not red .
the life of the delta is partly interlaced because of junks , which were once numerous with their fanlike silhouettes , trading down into southeast asia and up the coast of china .
the junk â€” the word â€™ s origins are murky , with chinese , malay and portuguese cited as influences â€” may have assumed its iconic , curved hull and sails about 1 , 000 years ago , during the song dynasty , though written records are scarce .
â€ mr. au â€™ s life reflects the sweep of delta geography .
he is unsure where he was born but knows his father was from guangdong province in china , through which the pearl river runs .

to resist is to do something negative â€” to push back against someone else â€™ s agenda when your own back is up against the wall .
a call to resist is different from a call to â€œ organize â€ or â€” to borrow a word from the age of obama â€” to â€œ dream .
resistance names what you don â€™ t want and leaves the vision thing for another , less urgent situation .
resistance evokes the struggle against totalitarianism , conveying personal defiance and official powerlessness at the same time .
that resistance involved armed conflict and personal risk of the bleakest sort , with guerrilla fighters hiding in the catacombs of paris while hitler â€™ s forces did their worst above ground .
it was a fight to the death , and in early 1940s europe , before the arrival of allied troops , the outcome was far from certain .
after the war , anticolonial movements from south africa to northern ireland found their own strategies of resistance , settling in for long , sometimes bloody fights .
the united states introduced its own peculiar twist on this idea , transforming a rallying cry of liberation into a defense of white supremacy .
sometimes this meant studying organized revolts , like slave rebellions or peasant uprisings .
enslaved or oppressed people might resist by taking up arms , but they might also resist simply by refusing to do as they were told .
during world war i , for instance , the united states banned criticism of the government , interned thousands of german americans and instituted widespread surveillance of immigrants and political radicals .
there are conservative versions of this story , too .
â€ but the mere act of refusal often turns out to have its own momentum .

airlines that had been stopping travelers from boarding planes to the united states were told by the government in a conference call friday night to begin allowing them to fly , according to a person familiar with the call but who declined to be identified because it was a private discussion .
some arrived at airports for flights and were turned away .
besides barring refugees and other visa holders from the seven countries from entering the united states , the administration also revoked , at least temporarily , all visas from the seven countries , including those for people currently living in the united states .
the revocations , which were not publicly announced but were revealed during court proceedings , meant that anyone who lost their visa would be unable to the united states if they left .
dr. abushamma â€™ s case was highlighted at a hearing in federal district court in brooklyn on thursday , where judge carol b. amon extended until feb. 21 the initial ruling â€” formally known as a stay of removal â€” issued last week by her colleague , judge ann m. donnelly .
lawyers for the plaintiffs described dr. abushamma â€™ s detention and deportation during thursday â€™ s hearing .

this week the new york times reported that mr. viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in eastern air lines for a stake in swift air , an airline with government subcontracts .
both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity .
mr. viola has a net worth of almost $ 1 .

in an episode unrelated to the finances of mr. viola , it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in august : he was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in saratoga springs , n. y .
he also signed a memorandum that paves the way for reversing a policy , known as the fiduciary rule , that requires brokers to act in a client â€™ s best interest , rather than seek the highest profits for themselves , when providing retirement advice .
supporters of the rule describe it as a basic consumer protection to prevent brokers from taking advantage of vulnerable clients .
â€ the 2010 act reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading and curbed the ability of banks to trade with their own money in a measure known as the volcker rule .

â€ the sanctions themselves are unlikely to have a significant effect on iranian action .
mr. obama took similar steps a year ago , after another iranian missile test .
the iranians have largely complied with every provision of the deal , according to the international atomic energy agency , which conducts regular inspections of the nuclear facilities .
when small violations have been found , the iranians have quickly rectified them , including by shipping fuel out of the country .
but nothing in the nuclear agreement deals with iran â€™ s support of hezbollah or other terrorist groups , or its missile testing .
a united nations security council resolution , also negotiated in vienna as the nuclear accord was being completed , calls on iran to show restraint in testing , and prohibits test flights of a missile that could carry a nuclear warhead .
it is unclear exactly what iran was testing last weekend .
its missile traveled about 600 miles before its vehicle exploded .
that may have been accidental , or an intentional detonation .
but in both washington and tehran , the test itself was clearly less important than the symbolism of the moment .
but senator mark warner , democrat of virginia , who serves on the senate intelligence committee , warned against provoking iran into further action .

â€ ''
the year was 1983 , and mr. puzder was working at a law firm owned by a famous mob lawyer and casino owner whom the labor department accused of squandering $ 25 million from his union workers â€™ pension funds on sham investments .
the jury did not buy it .
mr. puzder â€™ s boss , morris a. shenker , was hit with a $ 34 million judgment and filed for bankruptcy .
â€œ back then , he represented a guy who thought it was o. k. to screw his employees .
he has indicated his preference for machines over people because they do not take time off or file lawsuits .
â€ because he was a lawyer representing a client , the positions that mr. puzder took in the case do not necessarily represent his personal views .
mr. puzder is chief executive of cke .
he was also a mob lawyer .
in 1973 , he took control of the dunes hotel and casino in las vegas and a resort in california .
mr. puzder joined the firm full time after graduating in 1978 , a career choice that bewildered some who knew him .
the firm was fading in relevance , with its famous principal spending much of his time in las vegas .
the appellate judges denied mr. puzder â€™ s appeal .
â€ he insisted on all but shutting down the flow of money .
in 1977 , the labor department sued mr. shenker , accusing him of failing to repay the $ 24 .
9 million it said he had illegally borrowed from the southern nevada culinary and bartenders pension trust .
the total represented more than half of the trust â€™ s assets .
the case proceeded slowly .
seven lawyers were sent to las vegas from washington .
mr. puzder , then 32 , and a colleague from the shenker firm , e. michael murphy , left st. louis for las vegas .
after regaining his composure , he attacked government regulators , claiming they had a â€œ vendetta â€ against his boss .
â€œ some people in the department of labor were more concerned with pursuing shenker than they were with recovering the trust â€™ s money , â€ mr. puzder said , according to the las vegas sun .
â€ the specter of organized crime hung over the trial .
tapes of a 1979 meeting between mr. shenker and two mob figures â€” joey ( the clown ) lombardo and allen dorfman , a liaison between the mob and hoffa â€™ s teamsters union â€” revealed mr. dorfman complaining that mr. shenker had failed to pay him kickbacks on millions in loans that mr. shenker had procured from the teamsters .
the government was determined to reduce the shenker case to its most basic elements .
he didn â€™ t .
â€™ â€ the jurors agreed .
after the trial , mr. shenker was required to repay all the money he had borrowed , plus interest , for a total of $ 34 million .
â€œ i â€™ d be like the pension fund .
i â€™ d lose on the deal .
â€ months later , mr. shenker filed for bankruptcy , citing $ 184 million in obligations .
about that time , mr. puzder and mr. murphy left his firm , which limped along until mr. shenker was indicted on bankruptcy and tax fraud charges in 1989 .
during the bankruptcy case , government lawyers were able to extract $ 26 million for the pension fund , mr. temchine said .

last year , more than 700 , 000 people signed up in the last week alone .
but they show how important signaling is , and how confused the signaling currently is .
mr. trump â€™ s executive order , signed on the day of his inauguration , was widely reported as eliminating the law â€™ s requirement to buy insurance .
( i differ with that view . )
and the reductions in outreach may have prevented some people who intended to sign up from getting the reminder that they needed .
more broadly , promises from mr. trump and republicans in congress to quickly repeal obamacare may have caused some people to think the law was no longer in effect at all .
the 9 .
of course , some people who signed up during the enrollment period may drop out of coverage or simply fail to pay their premiums , meaning the number of people who will be covered in obamacare plans is likely to be lower than the current numbers .
moreover , people who signed up early for plans because they thought it was required may drop coverage if they come to believe they will face no penalty .
that path is hard to predict .
â€œ we look forward to providing relief to those who are being harmed by the status quo .

now , increasingly , they â€™ re also in china .
from the 1950s through the 1980s , the united states carefully guarded its advantage .
in the late 1980s , the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the pentagon â€™ s ability to control technological progress .
rapid chinese progress has touched off a debate in the united states between military strategists and technologists over whether the chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the united states in the field .
known as the long range missile , or l. r. a. s. m. it is described as a â€œ semiautonomous â€ weapon .
andrew ng , chief scientist at baidu , said the united states may be too myopic and to understand the speed of the chinese competition .
â€œ but then u. s. media reports only on the u. s. version .
the company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between and texts .
the speed of the chinese technologists , compared to united states and european artificial intelligence developers , is noteworthy .
last april , gansha wu , then the director of intel â€™ s laboratory in china , left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from intel and google to build a car company .
last month , the company , uisee technology , met its goal â€” taking a demonstration to the international consumer electronics show in las vegas â€” after just nine months of work .
the united states â€™ view of china â€™ s advance may be starting to change .
last october , a white house report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that china is now publishing more research than scholars here .
his firm , sinovation ventures , has recently raised $ 675 million to invest in a. i. both in the united states and in china .
last year , china also brought the world â€™ s fastest supercomputer , the sunway taihulight , online , supplanting another chinese model that had been the world â€™ s fastest .
the earlier supercomputer , the tianhe 2 , was powered by intel â€™ s xeon processors after it came online , the united states banned further export of the chips to china , in hopes of limiting the chinese push into supercomputing .

849,18252 , '' the met opera â€™ s â€˜ rusalka â€™ is a dark , sexy hit - the new york times '' , new york times , anthony tommasini,2017-02-04,2017.0,2.0 , , '' the metropolitan opera â€™ s new production of dvorak â€™ s â€œ rusalka â€ may be the unlikeliest hit of the season , a staging that takes opera â€™ s answer to â€œ the little mermaid â€ fairy tale and turns it into an almost shockingly dark , sexy drama .
the mysterious look of the production , fantastical and ominous , combines with the sensual singing of a handsome cast to create a romantic energy rare at the met â€” or at any opera house .
at the opening on thursday , mark elder conducted a glowing account of dvorak â€™ s score .
the pond is a forbidding pool from which mists slowly spew the willow tree on which rusalka rests is twisted and creepy .
as vodnik , the water gnome who presides over the meadow , the earthy , stentorian eric owens looks endearingly foolish in a robe and crown .
when rusalka , who is vodnik â€™ s daughter , starts to tell her father about her sorrows and longing , ms. opolais , with golden hair and a gaze , wears an aqua gown with long , flowing trails , almost like rivulets of lake water .
and with her fidgety physical gestures and darting eyes , ms. opolais conveys the character â€™ s restlessness and pining .
this powerful singing actress adds unusual intensity to her plaintive â€œ song to the moon , â€ rusalka â€™ s famed lament , suggesting the character â€™ s defiant side more than most sopranos .
the transformation takes place atop a surgical table , attended to by a valet and a maid who are here dressed as a giant , eerie mouse and a crow .
ms. zimmerman presses a dark vision of the patriarchal oppression at the root of the fairy tale .
when she finally succumbs to his passion , mr. jovanovich lifts ms. opolais into his arms .
the staging suggests that the reborn rusalka may not really be free , but is simply adapting to a new set of strictures .
loving the prince means submitting to him .
( the choreographer is austin mccormick , in his met debut . )
but the doomed rusalka has become a moonlit phantom , as she warns the prince .
by kissing her , he dies .

among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was airbnb , which had decided just last week to run an ad .
revived an ad it ran during the 2014 super bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of â€œ america the beautiful .
it â€™ s a big smack in the face of â€˜ dude , this is america .
a advertiser , 84 lumber , had its initial proposal for a commercial rejected by fox last month for being â€œ too controversial â€ because it showed a mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the united states and mexico .
the hashtag # boycottbudweiser trended on twitter early on sunday evening , apparently started by people who disliked the ad .
mr. clean was unexpectedly portrayed as something of a sex symbol .
â€ advertisers were willing to pay , on average , about $ 5 million for spots during the super bowl this year â€” or around $ 167 , 000 per second â€” and even more in promotional costs to reach the game â€™ s more than 100 million viewers .
many released the full ads or teasers online before sunday while brands such as snickers and hyundai went the opposite route , producing their commercials during the game itself , which aired on fox .

we have resolved , and a popular fixture in our resolutions is booze .
it began in a trickle that became a geyser .
now we are pickled .
which is why january , though a poor time for drinking alcohol , is a good time for cooking with it .
in particular , with wine â€” which is , in the elegant and spiritually stirring formulation of robert farrar capon , the late episcopal priest and cookbook author , â€˜ â€˜ water that has matured according to nature â€™ s will .
the alcohol in wine evaporates more quickly than water and is mostly gone after 30 minutes â€™ cooking .
what is left is the taste of the grape that made it , among dozens of ghost flavors : cherry , violet , ash , pineapple , fresh leather , apple , black pepper , wet soil , mandarin , lilac or rose .
plus , a light acidity that keeps the palate alive and alert , and an unmistakable elegance that can be neither explained nor ignored .
the food writer richard olney recommends soupe Ã  la bourguignonne , â€˜ â€˜ red wine soup â€™ â€™ : pork fat , butter , onions , flour , water , stale bread , herbs and almost an entire bottle of red wine .
olney also describes a â€˜ â€˜ typical bordelais tourain , â€™ â€™ which is usually eaten during the harvest but could stand a winter reprise .
its ingredients are onions cooked in fat , salt , tomatoes , sugar , boiling water , stale bread and dry white wine .
â€˜ â€˜ a native , â€™ â€™ olney writes , â€˜ â€˜ may first eat his sopped bread crust , empty out his ( red ) wine glass into the soup , and drink the rest from the soup plate , a performance known as faire chabrol â€™ â€™ â€” that is , â€˜ â€˜ to act like a little goat .
coq au vin is of this lineage .
there are a few questions that bedevil those who decide to try their hands at cooking with booze .
what kind of wine ?
if a fine wine is going to be put anywhere but a glass , it must stay unchanged until it reaches its final destination .
can it be too bad ?
it is also the alcohol that disappears in cooking .
don â€™ t worry if uncooked wine tastes oxidized before it is added to a braise or stew â€” as long as it tasted good in its past , however distant .
are there spirits that shouldn â€™ t be cooked in ?
all of them are , however , capable of sousing and pickling a fish as they are of sousing and pickling a human .
and to more attractive ends .

kathie was kathleen durst , ms. hughes â€™ s younger sister , who at 29 was in the final months of medical school .
john lewin , a deputy district attorney in los angeles , claims that mr. durst shot ms. berman in the back of her head at her los angeles home in december 2000 , fearing that she would cooperate with a newly revived investigation into ms. durst â€™ s disappearance .
a large photograph of kathie durst dressed in an annie dress and a hat from the wild west hung over the fireplace .
â€ the obsession nearly destroyed her .
â€œ it was a mutual attraction , a chemistry , â€ ms. hughes recalled .
â€œ he had a magnetism .
kathie had the same thing .
â€ the hugheses liked mr. durst when he started dating kathie , then 19 , in early 1971 .
after their second date , mr. durst asked kathie to move with him to vermont to run a health food store .
the couple partied at studio 54 , the disco that was a haunt for celebrities and others .
they sailed on the mediterranean sea and traveled to thailand .
bob and kathie socialized with mary and tom , even buying a racehorse together from a friend who was a breeder .
â€ but the dursts â€™ relationship took a dark turn after 1976 , when mr. durst forced his wife to have an abortion .
he didn â€™ t want children she did .
ms. durst sought independence , enrolling in nursing school in danbury , conn .
the couple bought a cottage nearby , on lake truesdale in south salem , n. y. in northern westchester county , but also had a on riverside drive in manhattan and rented an apartment on the east side .
after graduating from nursing school , ms. durst immediately started medical school at albert einstein college of medicine in the bronx , hoping to become a pediatrician .
â€œ she was excited to be a medical student , â€ recalled a classmate , dr. alicia .
she always took a seat in the front row and took notes .
â€ by 1980 , the couple quarreled frequently , ms. hughes said , adding that her sister often called her with accounts of their latest fight .
ms. durst contacted a divorce lawyer .
on another occasion , he stormed into their east side apartment , where ms. durst was talking with friends , and kicked an acquaintance in the face .
the man later settled a lawsuit over the episode with mr. durst .
three weeks before ms. durst disappeared , she was treated at jacobi medical center in the bronx for bruises she suffered during an argument with her husband , according to several friends and medical records later recovered by investigators .
it was the last time ms. mcinerney saw her .
a week later , mr. durst walked into a manhattan police station to file a missing person â€™ s report .
why did he lie ?
â€ frustrated by what they regarded as a desultory investigation by new york city detectives , ms. hughes and a small band of friends became amateur sleuths , tracking sightings of her sister and mr. durst and scouring phone records .
â€ they found ms. durst â€™ s diamond earrings in her drawer at the riverside drive apartment , which mr. durst had told the police she was wearing when she disappeared .
ms. hughes and ms. mcinerney pored over pages and pages of phone records from the cottage , the apartments and the durst organization that they had gotten from the detectives .
ms. hughes and ms. mcinerney borrowed a car and drove the investigating detectives down to ship bottom .
mr. durst was not charged with any crime .
ms. hughes and her family wrestled with mr. durst in surrogate â€™ s court for control of ms. durst â€™ s estate , but suffered another defeat in 1983 .
â€œ i broke down .
i couldn â€™ t do it anymore .
â€ for a long time , she refused to drive a car or even leave her apartment .
in the end , ms. hughes was left without answers as to her sister â€™ s fate .
ms. hughes , her husband and ms. mcinerney cooperated with an investigation into ms. durst â€™ s disappearance that was started in 2000 by an enterprising state police investigator , joe becerra , only to be disappointed again when the local district attorney did not indict mr. durst .

â€œ let â€™ s go crazy , â€ mr. osbourne yelled to the crowd , adding an expletive early in the concert , before turning in thrashing renditions of the band â€™ s songs , including â€œ war pigs , â€ â€œ into the void â€ and â€œ iron man , â€ and deeper cuts like the instrumental â€œ rat salad .
flanked by the original band members tony iommi ( on guitar ) and geezer butler ( on bass ) and backed by tommy clufetos , a younger drummer who rejoined them for the tour , mr. osbourne stood center stage and clutched the microphone , undulating back and forth as he sang .
giant black and purple balloons spilled from the ceiling in the penultimate song , and bounced around the arena for the rest of the night .
nearly a ago , black sabbath began as a blues band .
it quickly morphed into its own genre .
mr. osbourne gained a reputation as a forbidding figure who embraced hard living , and gained notoriety for biting off the head of a real bat during a 1982 concert .
but mr. osbourne â€™ s fame underwent a surprising shift when he began starring in the 2002 mtv reality tv show â€œ the osbournes , â€ which portrayed him as a lovable , murmuring goofball and family man .
on saturday , the crowd was dotted with fans decked out in black sabbath regalia .
â€ the band has always identified as rough and tumble , alternative , working class and distinctly birminghamian , so the hometown concert had special resonance for some in the audience on saturday .
â€ mr. lynch , originally from ireland , was in birmingham to see the group for the third time in the space of a week .
when the last song , â€œ paranoid , â€ ended , he blew a kiss , took some final bows , then stopped to have his picture taken with his bandmates before loping off the stage .

the presence of the ambassador , stanislav osadchiy , delighted greek cypriot politicians in nicosia , the capital of the south of the divided island .
but accusations that moscow intervened to skew the united states presidential election and supported forces across europe have stirred a wave of alarm about russia in the european union , of which the republic of cyprus is a member .
makarios drousiotis , a researcher who has long bucked sentiment in cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as russian meddling , said events in the united states and europe were shaking his compatriots â€™ view that moscow had only their best interests at heart .
gas from egyptian , israeli and cypriot fields in the mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from gazprom , but it has little chance of reaching turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between greek and turkish cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines .

soon after , he acquired blackhawk â€™ s film library , which became the basis for film preservation associates .

there is an international wrestling meet scheduled for may in times square , an annual contest pitting top americans against international stars .
mr. trump â€™ s order is a complicated issue for the united states olympic committee , which calls itself â€œ the steward of the olympic movement in the united states .
the committee is invested in a bid to bring the 2024 summer games to los angeles , and that bid â€™ s chances have been damaged by the executive order , which alarmed some of the international olympic committee members who will select the host city .

here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos â€” an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag â€” and confident enough in his taste to wear a suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy .

they are an emblem of mr. trump â€™ s management style , but also a reminder that in the white house , the seats always outlast the people seated in them .
the likely answer to both questions : a lot .
but other parts of the constitution may temper or defeat that power .
the case is now before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco .
judge robart â€™ s brisk ruling contained almost no reasoning .
judge gorton also sketched out the broader picture .
and also people who had lived here for a long time and happened to be overseas at the time of this order , which came with no warning whatsoever , and suddenly lost the right to return to the united states .
it says , â€œ whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states , he may by proclamation , and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate .

but by the time the election was over , the campaign had pulled in only $ 76 , 324 .
no longer .
the brief , which was signed by an unusually broad coalition of large and small tech companies that included apple , facebook , microsoft , google , tesla , uber and intel , said mr. trump â€™ s order â€œ violates the immigration laws and the constitution .
that modest approach , which even the most executive can endorse , showed its limits last week .
â€œ they all have the same leanings .
google â€™ s former slogan â€œ don â€™ t be evil â€ is the most forceful expression of this .
microsoft , for instance , initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration .

â€ a political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office , 314 action , has seen a surge of interest in its programs , with more than 2 , 000 people registering at its website .
individuals and groups have also spoken out against mr. trump â€™ s executive order restricting travel for citizens of iran , iraq and five other countries , an action that has affected some researchers .
but certainly there â€™ s an elevated sense that this is very real .
an anonymous donor has provided storage on amazon servers , and the information can be searched from a website at the university of pennsylvania called data refuge .
but the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety .

the california today columnist , mike mcphate , is a californian â€” born outside sacramento and raised in san juan capistrano .
he lives in davis .
berkeley . ''
he noted that his predecessor , tom wheeler , had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election .
is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download .
â€œ i think it â€™ s a down payment on net neutrality , with much more to follow .
the reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules .
a federal court upheld the rules last year , and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules .
congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency â€™ s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules .
also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers .
â€ most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around mr. pai â€™ s early actions .
remember â€œ civil procedure in sweden , â€ by justice ruth bader ginsburg ?
or â€œ regulation and its reform , â€ by justice stephen g. breyer ?
perhaps not .
it discusses the supreme court â€™ s abortion jurisprudence in detail , but judge gorsuch â€™ s goal was not to critique those cases .
â€ that is about right .
his account of roe v. wade , for instance , is straightforward .
â€œ under roe â€™ s express holding , â€ judge gorsuch wrote , â€œ a fetus does not qualify as a person .
â€ in a footnote , he described a contrary view from a 1986 dissent .
the task there , he said , was balancing â€œ the interests of those persons who wish to control the timing of their deaths and those vulnerable individuals whose lives may be taken without their consent due to mistake , abuse or pressure in a regime where assisted suicide is legal .
â€ judge gorsuch also worked for justice anthony m. kennedy during his clerkship for justice white , who had by then retired .
in the book , judge gorsuch argued that the decision should be read narrowly , in an apparent attempt to limit its implications for a right to assisted suicide or euthanasia .
he acknowledged that the controlling opinion in casey â€” from justices kennedy , sandra day o â€™ connor and david h. souter â€” contained sweeping language , and he quoted what he called its â€œ mystery of life â€ passage , which is generally attributed to justice kennedy .
but the opinion also relied on a second and narrower ground , saying that respect for precedent â€” stare decisis , in legal latin â€” required the court to follow roe .
judge gorsuch argued that the flowery stuff was an aside .
â€ he added that his colleagues might be prepared to discover a right to assisted suicide in the constitution .

â–  republicans in congress will also vote to roll back regulations .
mr. pence may be summoned to the capitol early this week to cast the 51st vote to confirm ms. devos as education secretary over vociferous , now bipartisan objections .
senators susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska thrust ms. devos â€™ s nomination into question last week when they became the first two republicans to declare their opposition .
once the senate deals with the devos nomination , it will move on to the nomination of mr .
that is when brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the atlanta falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a super bowl .
in accepting the vince lombardi trophy from commissioner roger goodell , who meted out the punishment , the owner robert k. kraft did not outright address the scandal .
it took more than a decade for the falcons to reach the playoffs , more than three to advance to a conference championship and more than four to stack consecutive winning seasons .
the falcons traded brett favre and had a coach , bobby petrino , notify players that he was quitting by leaving notes at their lockers .
quinn may never again coach a defense as fast and physical â€” words emblazoned on a bracelet he has worn â€” as seattle â€™ s , but for the first three quarters on sunday , the falcons harassed brady , swarmed the ball and created turnovers , converting both of new england â€™ s mistakes before halftime into 14 points .
most obvious was the falcons â€™ speed advantage , and how , as quinn â€™ s seahawks did against denver in the 2014 game , they parlayed it into momentum .
the super bowl was enjoyable , until it wasn â€™ t .
those who can not handle the atmosphere are weeded out like overwhelmed med students .
only this time , instead of watching opponents do the impossible â€” david tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or mario manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or jermaine kearse contorting himself â€” it was the patriots who amazed .
while falling , edelman caught a tipped pass , then dropped it , then cradled the ball just before it would have touched the ground .
â€œ i don â€™ t know how the hell he caught it .
i mean , i don â€™ t think anybody â€” i don â€™ t think he does .
â€ it only mattered that he did , and after white scored with 57 seconds left and danny amendola converted the tying conversion , the patriots called heads , won the coin toss and never let atlanta touch the ball again .
the patriots reached the final game , just as they thought they would .
and now , after sunday , after winning yet another super bowl , he struck a familiar pose : holding the lombardi trophy as confetti fell . ''
and she started belting her hits , with a nod to the local audience : â€œ poker face â€ announced , â€œ i want to hold â€™ em like they do in texas .
â€œ you â€™ re black , white , beige , chola â€™ re lebanese , you â€™ re orient , â€ she sang , and later , â€œ no matter gay , straight , or transgendered â€™ m on the right track was born to survive .
â€ it was doubtless the first time the word â€œ transgendered â€ had been sung at a super bowl halftime show .
but most of the show was simply about pop fun : songs like â€œ telephone , â€ about dancing at clubs , and â€œ bad romance , â€ about falling in love and lust .
it was a megamix of her songs spanning her career , from her 2008 debut single , â€œ just dance , â€ to â€œ million reasons , â€ the power ballad from her 2016 album , â€œ joanne .
she sang with hardworking gusto throughout the set , even as she covered considerable yardage strutting and kicking , prancing and gesticulating , pumping her hips and shaking hands with fans .
consumers need to be informed about what they are taking , and in what doses .
those who take any kind of pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor , she added .
the warnings surfaced because patients were taking tylenol with other medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen .
for instance , the prescription painkiller percocet and cold and flu remedies have tylenol in them .
â€œ you may not think you are taking that much tylenol , but yes you are , â€ he said .
common brand names : bayer and st. joseph .
it is also found in excedrin .
recommended to treat : headaches and pain from inflammation .
it is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health .
patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor .
â€œ a lot of the patients don â€™ t take these medications seriously .

these brackish waters are the cradle of vibrio cholerae , a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out .
water loss turns victims ashen their eyes sink into their sockets , and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries .
cholera probably had festered here for eons .
artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet .
today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like ethiopia or haiti .
the world health organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades .
soon , there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold .
â€ research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten america .
the wards , which in the rainy season extend into tents in the parking lot , contain long rows of â€œ cholera cots .
a bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea , while another beside the cot fills with vomit .
an iv pole completes the setup .
defying expectations , the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with .
it contains a blend of glucose , electrolytes and water .
cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves , but it does not actually damage the gut cells .
if the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by antibiotics , the patient is usually fine .
within hours , patients start to revive .
the techniques perfected here are so effective that the icddr , b has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade .
usually , the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them .
they live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers , who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils , squash , onions , greens and oil .
the rest usually have rotavirus , salmonella or e. coli .
his roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning , unconscious and with no detectable pulse .
mr. mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a. m. a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner .
â€œ usually i drink safe water , filtered water , â€ he explained .
â€œ but i drank the city water last night .
i think that is what did this .
â€ cholera , born in the swamps , arrived long ago in dhaka .
the city is home to more that 15 million , and a third of the population lives in slums .
vibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter .
because cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in china , india , nigeria and many other countries , scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon : a cheap , effective vaccine .
in the 1980s , a swedish scientist , dr. jan holmgren , invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time .
transporting tanks of buffer was impractical .
dr. holmgren and dr. john d. clemens , an american vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the icddr , b , obliged .
he had tested it on 70 , 000 residents of hue , in central vietnam , and had found it to be 60 percent effective .
but dr. dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial , and vietnam â€™ s vaccine factory did not meet w. h. o. standards , so no united nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine .
it was very relaxed , sort of , â€˜ here â€™ s $ 40 million .
the agency approved shanchol in 2011 , and since then , the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance .
in 2013 , an emergency stockpile was started , and the gavi alliance committed $ 115 million to raise it to six million doses .
a second version , euvichol , from south korea , was approved in 2015 .
with 1 .
4 billion people at risk , the potential cost of vaccination in countries is enormous .

but the bill gained internal momentum through several forces : mr. netanyahu is determined to show his support to the powerful settler movement , and is under pressure from on the right and from corruption investigations that even his supporters say appear serious .
the law provides for compensation to palestinian landowners .
â€ he added , â€œ they are passing a law which endangers our soldiers , will undermine our international standing and undermine us as a country of law and order .
the international significance of the vote on monday was underscored during mr. netanyahu â€™ s quick trip to visit prime minister theresa may of britain .
â€ appearing before reporters with mrs. may in london , mr. netanyahu , who has in the past tepidly supported a solution , did not do so on monday .
â€œ the land of israel is ours , and this can not be disputed or be divided , â€ mr. akunis responded .
â€œ the concept of settlement blocs is no longer relevant because there are no arabs to negotiate with anymore .

â€ it â€™ s always 1799 at mount vernon , where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before washington â€™ s death , when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves .
she is also the subject of a book , â€œ never caught : the washingtons â€™ relentless pursuit of their runaway slave , ona judge , â€ by erica armstrong dunbar .
â€œ but decades before them , ona judge did this .
why don â€™ t i know about her ?
â€™ â€ ms. dunbar recalled .
when judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on martha â€™ s death , george washington dismissed her demand as â€œ totally inadmissible .
â€ in august 1799 , washington , through another associate , tried again to capture her , but was foiled when judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared .
ms. dunbar calls washington â€™ s act â€œ no small thing , â€ but does not see the former president , who had no biological children to disinherit , as the hero of the story .
â€œ he dealt with it after his death .
and you know what ?
that â€™ s what all the founders did with slavery : they kicked the can down the road .

at a meeting of european leaders in malta last week , mrs. may and ms. merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough .
after lunch , when it came to discussing the threats facing europe , mrs. may was shown the door .
mrs. may , whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country â€™ s departure from europe â€™ s single market , rushed to be the first foreign leader received by mr. trump after he took office .
â€œ opposites attract , â€ she beamed .
the invitation has since become a polarizing issue in britain â€™ s sharply divided political landscape , and reinforced a view on the continent that as britain cuts ties with europe , it will become america â€™ s lap dog .
â€ if ms. merkel can still afford to be an idealist , britain â€™ s plan to leave the european union , or â€œ brexit , â€ has turned mrs. may into a calculating realist .
upon arriving , mrs. may waffled in her judgment of mr. trump â€™ s travel ban , later stiffening her criticism after a public outcry .
she also negotiated a deal with turkey involving the british defense company bae systems .
â€ but only occasionally have there been glimpses of the partnership that might have been .
in july , ms. merkel was almost effusive in welcoming mrs. may , who chose berlin for her first foreign trip as prime minister .
their body language visibly loosened .
â€œ theresa may is nothing like margaret thatcher , but as it happens has quite a lot in common with angela merkel .
â€ each cautious and deliberate , they are both childless , have quiet husbands and enjoy watching sports .
( ms. merkel knows soccer mrs. may prefers cricket . )

both women endured condescension and outright misogyny as they rose .
mrs. may has been called a â€œ bloody difficult woman â€ by a fellow minister .
ms. merkel â€™ s predecessor and mentor , helmut kohl , patronized her as â€œ my girl .
mrs. may once wore a that read , â€œ this is what a feminist looks like .
â€ in 2005 , mrs. may a group called women2win to elect more women to parliament and then nurture them , something that mrs. thatcher was often criticized for not doing .
â€œ theresa may is not good at small talk , â€ said ms .
prince , the biographer .
â€œ she is not an easygoing , smooth person .

for her part , mrs. may has long expressed admiration for the german chancellor .

mrs. may has said she will turn britain into a competitor if no favorable deal is offered by the european union by the end of a negotiation .

about 61 percent of the civilian casualties are attributed to what unama calls â€œ antigovernment elements , â€ largely the taliban .
the united nations mission was especially concerned about an overall 24 percent rise in casualties involving children compared with 2015 , with 3 , 512 such episodes in 2016 causing 923 deaths and leaving 2 , 589 wounded .

the officials met in monaco on monday and voted unanimously to maintain the ban on russian athletes , outlining a timetable under which the nation would not be cleared to compete until november .
that agency has suggested it may grant russia partial certification in may , track officials said monday , and full certification in november .
â€œ they were unambiguous .
they were not suffused in politics .
scientific experts dismissed that explanation as impossible , calling it clear evidence of sample tampering .

( mr. ben ali was himself overthrown decades later during the arab spring uprising . )
mr. bourguiba â€™ s statue had replaced a humiliating symbol of colonialism : an image of the colonialist politician jules ferry with a tunisian woman at his feet proffering an olive branch , he reminded tunisians .
the young revolutionaries who spearheaded the arab spring uprising greeted the return of the statue with a flurry of jokes on social media about the waste of money .
mr. ghars described how mr. bourguiba had betrayed thousands of his fellow fighters when he accepted an interim deal with the french government that allowed the colonizers â€™ security forces to continue controlling the country .
â€œ they killed hundreds of young tunisian men , â€ he recalled .
â€œ these testimonies will reveal the truth .
â€ â€œ dictatorship always tries to keep things secret , â€ he explained .
â€œ these kinds of testimonies are against forgetting .
crowds have flocked in recent weeks to an exhibition on the opulent , and at times profligate , reign of tribal princes when tunisia was part of the ottoman empire .
the exhibit is housed in the ksar palace .
yet he is displaying events that tunisia â€™ s dictators sought to suppress .
â€œ our goal was to show that tunisian modernity did not start with independence or colonization .
another discovery is the diversity of tunisia â€™ s leaders â€” from the christian foreign minister , giuseppe raffo , to a circassian general , kheireddine pasha , and the former slave mustapha khaznadar , who married into the royal family and rose to become the bey himself .
one of the most popular displays â€” in the throne room , and beside the very table upon which it was signed â€” is the treaty of bardo , under which the beys , facing a crumbling dynasty and mounting debts , surrendered to become a french protectorate .
the show , originally announced in 2015 , is to premiere in new york during the season before embarking on a tour of â€œ traditional and nontraditional venues , â€ according to the universal music group .

â€œ she chose the piano .
he studied at the vienna academy of music until the german annexation of austria capped a period of growing there , during which he was arrested at least once and also forced to scrub streets on his knees .

956,18371 , dumping a bad app ?
tips for a painless breakup - the new york times , new york times , brian x. chen,2017-02-14,2017.0,2.0 , , '' everyone is familiar with this scenario : an app you once loved no longer brings the same joy .
chances are you thought about calling it quits .
take evernote , the app .
even so , people have stuck with evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy .
no app is perfect , but you have to draw the line somewhere .
the problem is , you may be in such a rut that you can â€™ t recognize the warning signs .
for instance , i called it quits on apple â€™ s calendar app when i was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in greenwich mean time rather than pacific standard time .
â€œ it â€™ s sort of a zombie app , i would call it at that point .
â€ another sign that it â€™ s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to .
if an app â€™ s audience is a ghost town â€” like yahoo â€™ s app , flickr , which sank in popularity after mobile services like instagram emerged â€” then it â€™ s probably time to leave .
yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about flickr .
so as a rule of thumb , save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app .
then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs .
it includes an â€œ export notes â€ feature , but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other apps .
microsoft â€™ s app onenote , along with apple â€™ s notes app , can easily import evernote records .
but if your app of choice is something else , such as google keep , you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app .
flickr is also difficult to part ways with .
getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor : you have to download all the photos , which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of images , and then upload them to a new photo service .
if there is no convenient way to export your data , sometimes it doesn â€™ t hurt to just take out what is most important to you .
ditching apple â€™ s calendar app was fairly easy .

957,18372 , how to buy a used car in an age of widespread recalls - the new york times , new york times , ron lieber,2017-02-14,2017.0,2.0 , , '' for people in the market for a used car , the â€œ certified â€ designation has long been the gold standard , an indication that a qualified mechanic has vouched for the car and that a buyer can expect a vehicle that is â€” hopefully â€” almost as good as new .
â€” will no longer necessarily have the same meaning .
and just as significantly , ford â€” with the f. t. c. settlement for cover â€” told its dealers this week that they could sell recalled vehicles and certify them too , so long as they did not advertise them as â€œ safe â€ and required buyers to sign forms acknowledging that they were aware of the problem .
he even sued a rival who he believes is selling recalled cars without disclosing that they have not been fixed yet .
for starters , the takata airbag recall is unprecedented in its scope , with over 60 million airbags affected , but also in its complexity .
on monday , however , ford broke ranks , issuing an update to dealers on its â€œ enhanced â€ recall process and giving them permission to certify used vehicles that had open recalls after all .
â€ so does ford believe there is no competitive advantage to be gained from fixing all recalled cars before selling them ?
â€œ it â€™ s very difficult to answer that , â€ sara tatchio , a ford spokeswoman , said .
moreover , dealers sometimes certify a car as clean and put it up for sale â€” and then it â€™ s recalled right after that .
â€ reaction in the industry to ford â€™ s move was somewhat muted .
audi , bmw , general motors , honda , kia , mazda and subaru said they had no plans to follow ford â€™ s move .
toyota â€™ s response was a bit more squishy .
â€œ we are not going to speculate on what impact the f. t. c. ruling may or may not have on toyota â€™ s current policy , â€ aaron fowles , a toyota spokesman , said via email .

by obama â€™ s second term , this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a of the sports website bleacher report started his own women â€™ s site , bustle .
feminism became increasingly popular , but in a very specific way â€” one attuned to the concerns of people with office jobs and time to spend online .
but it did become possible for an american woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist : there were feminist tv shows to watch , feminist celebrities to follow , feminist clothes to buy .
unlike many other major social movements , women â€™ s liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic , a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago .
to lady gaga , feminism was about protecting â€œ the integrity of women who are ambitious .
â€ feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation .
in 2008 , she argued that she wanted abortion to be â€œ safe , legal and rare â€” and by rare i mean rare .
â€ meanwhile , her campaign mimicked the aesthetics of the feminist mode .
the candidate who once shrank from feminism was positioning herself as an icon of the movement .
â€œ let â€™ s see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world .
â€œ pantsuit nation has four million members and decides its main mission is â€˜ storytelling â€™ and now , selling books .
what a colossal waste .
â€ but for some outside observers , this was a productive comeuppance .
â€ in those same november weeks , the nascent project was navigating its own identity crisis .
some of the early organizers had jobs â€” pastry chef , yoga instructor .
one of the women , bob bland , a fashion designer , had amassed a small online following by designing â€œ nasty woman â€ and â€œ bad hombre â€ and selling them online .
â€œ i had this whole network of â€˜ nasty women â€™ and â€˜ bad hombres , â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ she told me .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ disparate organizers convened around a facebook event announcing a million women march .
there was one major problem with this : in 1997 , activists organized a million woman march in philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women .
comments began pouring in from all sides .
frances gage , the woman running the show , recalled the scene 12 years later : â€œ the leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall , gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban , surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet , march deliberately into the church , walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps .
â€ a â€œ buzz of disapprobation â€ spread through the church .
â€œ every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers , and we shall be utterly denounced .
â€ throughout the convention , men arrived to speak out against women â€™ s suffrage .
and ain â€™ t i a woman ?
gage wrote that truth â€™ s testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her â€œ with streaming eyes , and hearts beating with gratitude .
over time , these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions .
clubs leveraged women â€™ s leisure time to campaign for social reforms .
in 1913 , when thousands of suffragists marched on washington to agitate for the vote , black women were instructed to march in the back .
ida b .
she wasn â€™ t just protesting for her right to vote .
she was protesting the protest too .
â€ friedan â€™ s 1963 book , â€œ the feminine mystique , â€ had been an awakening for a class of white , married , women , and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a â€œ mainstream â€ feminist movement .
as the black feminist and leftist barbara smith told the national women â€™ s studies association in 1979 , any feminism that didn â€™ t account for the specific concerns of black women , poor women , disabled women , lesbians and others was not really feminism â€” it was â€œ merely female .
she told various reporters that she had met women working â€œ in so many different intersectionalities â€ and hoped to reach a â€œ a wide intersectionality of people â€ in a march that reflected â€œ all of the different intersections of human rights .
â€ that magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar kimberlÃ© crenshaw that was published in the university of chicago legal forum .
crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be â€œ compound discrimination â€ â€” both racial and gender biases .
but they were often told they lacked legal standing : laws protected them from discrimination as or as women , but not specifically as black women .
even beneath the shiny surface of pop feminism , dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness , its lack of its sometimes shallow concerns .
( it â€™ s hard to â€œ lean in â€ to a job cleaning hotel rooms . )
com , on bustle and in a tweet from clinton .
often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off , met with defensiveness , taken personally .
â€ at this critical moment , with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own , wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name million women march .
these women hadn â€™ t necessarily supported clinton , and they didn â€™ t necessarily identify as feminists .
in 2015 , they organized a march from new york to washington , ending in a rally at the capitol that drew a small crowd .
â€ the organizers appeared on the radio morning show â€œ the breakfast club â€ and loaded their instagram page with black feminist heroes .
but they also posed for windswept photos in vogue , and some dropped by the wing , a private manhattan women â€™ s club with a $ 2 , 250 annual membership fee .
their rally put angela davis on the same stage as scarlett johansson .
â€œ we were in this sea of humanity .
it was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time .
this conversation isn â€™ t always happening in other spaces .
now it was all filtered through my own bubble â€” that of a white woman who lives in brooklyn .
twitter lit up with notes of internal dissent and snapshots of signs from the march : don â€™ t forget : white women voted for trump and black women tried to save y â€™ all and i â€™ ll see you nice white ladies at the next # blacklivesmatter march , right ?
congressional switchboards were inundated with calls .
breitbart published photos with the headline â€œ see what a massive , hillary shaped bullet america just dodged ? â€ the media research center aggregated the most â€œ vile and ridiculous signs .
trump supporters call themselves â€œ the silent majority , â€ while his critics identify as the â€œ popular vote .
â€œ i think they â€™ re with us .
but of all the people who marched on washington last month , they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle .
â€œ i know of no other time when it would be more important , â€ barbara smith , the black feminist and leftist , told me .

they started wondering how â€” in reality â€” frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them , and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying .
first , the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye , requiring ms. noel and her colleagues to shoot video of a variety of frogs at the atlanta botanical garden and zoo atlanta .
then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue .
what they found was that frog saliva , which is normally 50 , 000 times stickier than human saliva , flows freely when it hits an insect .
when the frog tongue hits a cricket , the saliva becomes 100 times less viscous and flows around the cricket into every little crevice .
by the time the frog starts to pull its tongue back , in a much smoother and slower motion than the body slam attack , the saliva has gotten thick and sticky again and the tongue has wrapped all around the cricket .
the researchers published their findings in royal society interface .
not that they will have tongues , but they may need to grab and release â€” who knows what â€” with appendages more like tongues than metal claws .

they are covered in tiny little curved spikes , like claws , which , oddly enough , are very good at detangling snarls in fur . ''

russian law bars anyone with a criminal conviction from seeking elected office .
russian television is largely back under government control , as it was during soviet times , along with most formerly independent news agencies .
he has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption , exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary .

â€œ rightly so : we will win .

despite his earlier conviction , mr. navalny was allowed to run for mayor of moscow in 2013 .
he garnered 27 .
2 percent of the vote , just short of the threshold needed to force the candidate into a runoff â€” and enough to feed the kremlin â€™ s fears .

he won , 184 to 97 .
western diplomats quietly cheered on mr. mohamed , seeing him as the most organized â€” and least crooked â€” of the contenders .
the government provides few services and controls only small slices of territory .
the only reason it controls any territory is the presence of thousands of african union peacekeepers who have been battling the shabab for years , taking heavy casualties .
before entering politics , mr. mohamed worked as a diplomat for the somali government and later for the new york state department of transportation in buffalo .
he holds american and somali citizenship , and when he returned to his cubicle in buffalo after his short stint as prime minister , his baked him a cake . ''

more recently , christine lagarde , a former economy minister for mr. sarkozy who went on to head the international monetary fund , was convicted in december of negligence for misusing public funds , but the court did not impose a fine or a sentence .
at the time , the limit for presidential campaigns was about $ 18 .
the paris prosecutor â€™ s office said on tuesday that mr. sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $ 45 million , nearly twice the limit , and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants .
mr. sarkozy has repeatedly denied being aware of any false billing , and the prosecutors have not charged him with wrongdoing in that regard .
but he was knocked out of presidential primaries in november .
the revelations are especially damaging for mr. fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician , who , unlike his opponents â€” mr. sarkozy primarily â€” was untainted by legal scandals .
mr. fillon has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in the presidential race , despite opinion polls showing that he is no longer the favorite and might not advance to the second round of the elections . ''
a few months later , mr. ormsby gore , a former british ambassador to washington , proposed marriage .
she turned him down .
in a handwritten letter , filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty , she explained her decision to marry aristotle onassis instead .
among them is the letter to mr. ormsby gore , also known as lord harlech , dated nov. 13 , 1968 , a month after her marriage to mr. onassis and five months after the assassination of robert f. kennedy .
in it , mrs. kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for mr. ormsby gore , whose wife had died in a car crash in may 1967 .
â€ mr. ormsby gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of mr. onassis , and she tried to respond .

â€ â€œ it doesn â€™ t matter if you â€™ re paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better , pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food , â€ ms. sass said .
it was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer .
lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes , short ribs fell off the bone in 30 , and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes .
the most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken .
broccoli , kale , zucchini , fennel , brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing .
they also took longer to cook than if i had used a skillet on the stove .
i can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet , some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes .
another pressure cooker downside : they just don â€™ t do crisp or crunchy .
and in the future , i â€™ ll stick to roasting my whole chickens , so i can crunch on the shards of browned , salty skin .
same goes for my favorite red lentil soup .
although i didn â€™ t save any time when i tested it , i adored the convenience of not having to watch a pot on the stove .
and it â€™ s amazing for chickpeas , which take an hour all told instead of the usual three to four hours for unsoaked beans .
â€œ stick to soups , stews , beans and risotto .
â€ i â€™ d have to agree ms. sass â€™ s recipe for porcini mushroom risotto with peas is excellent , adaptable and about as easy as dinner gets ( once you source the dried porcinis and arborio rice , that is ) .
i also like the machine for polenta , which eliminates the stirring ( and the splatters of molten blobs ) .
i also tried out some of the other functions , including the slow cooker , rice cooker and yogurt maker settings .
it takes up a lot of space , it â€™ s not at all intuitive , and i hate not being able to check on my food as it cooks .

last year , the state budget for invasive species control was nearly doubled from 2015 , to $ 12 million .
the state mobilized in december after the discovery that oak trees in brooklyn and in suffolk county on long island were infected with oak wilt , a deadly fungus that chokes off trees â€™ internal water supply .
it was cut down last month to prevent the wilt â€™ s spread .
the discovery had set off a race to prune all 664 of the cemetery â€™ s oak trees while they are dormant for the winter as a barricade against the spread of disease .
across the country , invasive species cause over $ 100 billion in damage every year , according to the united states department of agriculture , from blighted crops to boats covered with sharp zebra mussels .
the overall budget for invasive species control is about $ 5 .
5 million .

by september , the designer â€™ s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by jessica alba and jessica seinfeld .
â€ that realization , somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles , accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance .
â€ that paucity of personalities is ascribed to a string of factors : celebrity overexposure , a generalized fashion fatigue and , chief among them , shrinking fashion budgets .
aware that the payoff may be negligible , many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands , or tens of thousands , of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of , say , a jessica chastain , a julianne moore or , for that matter , a lady gaga , pop culture luminaries who , once they arrive , may or may not deign to speak to the press .

â€ â€œ we â€™ re at the end of that cycle now , â€ he added .
â€œ it feels something from another era .
â€ by most accounts , that era dawned in the early to when the shows , once scattered in showrooms , galleries and ballrooms all over town , were brought together under the tents at bryant park .
it generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide .
in that seemingly innocent era , shows were trade events , largely the province of store buyers , journalists and a smattering of ladies who lunched .
that picture altered in the when uma thurman wore a prada dress to the oscars .
today , some argue , that content is debased .
â€œ it â€™ s no longer necessarily that hollywood diva .
â€œ those girls may be lovely , but they â€™ re not fashion .
â€ just as is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum .
lady gaga appeared last season at the show of brandon maxwell , her posing gamely for photographers but turning away reporters .

â€œ to have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense of heightened reality , â€ said michael kors , whose celebrity turnout last season included emily blunt cynthia erivo , the winning broadway star and sienna miller .
but for some designers , attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars .
â€ ( ms. hadid â€™ s mother is dutch her father is palestinian . )
plenty of people were impressed , among them designers of an altogether different ilk .
at their shows they tend to seat loyalists , prominent clients like the artists shirin neshat and kara walker , alongside such personalities as sandra bernhard .
â€ picking up the analogy , mr. martin added : â€œ these people are our personal icons , and there will be others .

then the exhibition moved to the south , and in november 1892 , the atlanta constitution newspaper printed a masterstroke of spin : an advertisement that said the cyclorama â€™ s scene was the â€œ only confederate victory ever painted .
but the crowds dwindled , in part because motion pictures increasingly replaced cycloramas as entertainment , and generations of decline began .
a major restoration that concluded in 1982 bought the atlanta cyclorama more time before the painting â€™ s quality and appeal began to wane again .
â€œ i remember it not being a typical permission slip that was quickly signed .

â€œ heck , it might be 3 in the morning .

hundreds of athletes from dozens of nations have signed petitions , threatened to boycott major events and called for sports authorities to act on evidence that the urine samples of dozens of russian athletes were tampered with to conceal widespread doping at the last winter olympics , in sochi , russia , in 2014 .
the association of international olympic winter sports federations cited four major competitions that had been moved out of russia for the season after an outcry from athletes , including the skiing world cup finals and the bobsled and skeleton world championships .
prominent athletes , including the french biathlon champion martin fourcade , a winner of two gold medals at sochi , had threatened to skip the competition unless officials addressed their concerns .
russia â€™ s national team itself could face disciplinary action ahead of the 2018 games , something some antidoping officials have called a parallel punishment for systemic cheating at the last winter olympics .

forbes reported on thursday that the team had a â€œ handshake agreement â€ to sell the team for about $ 1 .

the winner was a group backed by the financial firm guggenheim partners , which paid over $ 2 billion .
representatives for the kushners , the marlins and liontree declined to comment .
the marlins are currently owned by jeffrey loria , who paid $ 158 million for the team in 2002 after selling the montreal expos back to major league baseball .
still , mr. loria persuaded county to sell bonds to finance the construction of a new $ 639 million stadium .
critics of the agreement argued that the bond sale could eventually cost miami taxpayers more than $ 1 billion .
as part of the marlins â€™ agreement with the county , mr. loria would owe money if he sold the team within 11 years of signing the 2009 stadium agreement .

1014,18433 , can raf simons reinvent calvin klein ?
maybe yours .
â€ that name is synonymous with american fashion design in the 20th century , part of a small , pantheon that includes ralph ( lauren ) donna ( karan ) and oscar ( de la renta ) .
but you knew that .
she did not need to specify which calvin .
mr. simons , though by no means unknown , is not calvin .
his task is to bring energy and excitement back to calvin klein â€” and back , by extension , to new york fashion .
â€œ it â€™ s a busy schedule , but with a lot of things that don â€™ t speak to us .
from the obscure perch of his own raf simons men â€™ s wear label , he won over critics in paris in the late 1990s and early aughts .
yet the pace is only likely to quicken for mr. simons , who has relocated from antwerp , belgium , a city small enough that its fledgling designers count seeing him at the supermarket as a celebrity sighting , to manhattan , with a mandate to revivify calvin klein .
as if this were not enough , he has imported his namesake raf simons men â€™ s wear collection and keeps a studio for it in the calvin klein headquarters .
he is likely to repeat the trick with calvin klein on friday at its coed show during new york fashion week .
new york fashion week has lately been subject to defections of homegrown talent .
he is serious , intense and more discussed but less known by many in the fashion establishment than his more bombastic peers .
advertising may seem an ephemeral marker of change , but few were as aware of its power and potential as mr. klein himself .
many of the ads the fashion world considers iconic were manufactured at mr. klein â€™ s crk advertising studio : kate moss , nude , at her heroin chicest mark wahlberg , then known as marky mark , grabbing his groin through boxer briefs .
but mr. simons runs cool where mr. klein ran hot .
mr. klein â€™ s models were barely contained by their calvins , courting scandal and the occasional recall mr. simons â€™ s are gawky in the european style , and barely fill theirs out .
â€œ but i â€™ m not sure it â€™ s calvin .
it doesn â€™ t have the same sensuality or sexuality .
it doesn â€™ t have the physicality calvin always had .
it â€™ s more like raf simons .
2 billion in sales in 2015 , was seen by many as coasting and too diffuse .
â€ now mr. simons is busily reinterpreting the whole enterprise from the logo up .
â€ so much so that barneys agreed to carry the new collection sight unseen .
pvh â€™ s goal for calvin klein is to reach $ 10 billion in global sales by 2020 .
the majority of calvin klein revenue comes from its jeans , underwear and fragrances , according to magdalena kondej , the head of apparel and footwear research at euromonitor international .
calvin klein is a major draw at macy â€™ s , which sells its apparel and accessories , jeans , underwear , fragrances and home goods .
ms. coddington is cautiously optimistic about the pairing .
â€ ''
historically , their audiences have been limited .
â€ that exposure has shocked , and pleased , some who published the false information .
on albawaba , the headline read , â€œ kuwait issues its own visa ban for five countries .
â€ that article caught international attention , and a number of sites that often defend mr. trump â€™ s policies ran their own versions of it .

â€œ our only fault was to call it a visa ban when it should behoove us to call it extreme vetting , or maybe even a ban with few exceptions .
1016,18436 , former knick charles oakley is arrested after altercation at madison square garden - the new york times , new york times , mike vorkunov,2017-02-09,2017.0,2.0 , , '' when jeff hornacek took the job as the knicks coach last may , he did so with eyes wide open .
â€œ it â€™ s been something out here .
oakley was removed from madison square garden and handcuffed .
oakley was sitting courtside , in an aisle seat in the first row of the section near the knicks â€™ bench .
accounts of his behavior varied widely .
according to some spectators seated nearby , he had been calm early in the game .
he took a photograph with felice bergman , a fan with season tickets several rows higher .
but they did see oakley exchanging glances with a security guard who was standing several feet away .
oakley seemed to utter something to the guard when he walked by , according to t. j. veenstra , who was sitting behind oakley .
â€œ we didn â€™ t see him throw a punch or do anything .
he wasn â€™ t nasty to any of the people behind him .
we â€™ re trying to figure out what happened .
â€œ they overacted .
â€ the episode was a distraction from another knicks quarrel .
it was another shot in a feud between jackson and anthony that has persisted all season .
â€ anthony and jackson have met twice to calm the waters .
after oakley was taken away from his seat , jackson rushed out to the tunnel to try to calm him .
a. finals .
â€œ the boss don â€™ t like me , â€ oakley told the new york times last fall .
â€œ he won â€™ t meet .
i want to sit down to talk to him .
i want me and him in a room .
when he was eclipsed by security guards , doc rivers , the clippers coach and a former teammate , immediately recognized him at the center .
from some , it was a moment to switch to rival companies like lyft , which recently pledged a million dollars to the american civil liberties union .
aren â€™ t they all basically the same ?
â€ as wesley puts it : â€œ it â€™ s a protest .
â€ also , with the final season of â€œ girls â€ beginning on sunday night on hbo , we take a moment to talk about the show â€™ s legacy .
and after we talk about the show , we talk to it , with excerpts from jenna â€™ s recent conversation with the cast : lena dunham , allison williams , zosia mamet and jemima kirke .

1019,18440 , '' court refuses to reinstate travel ban , dealing trump another legal loss - the new york times '' , new york times , adam liptak,2017-02-13,2017.0,2.0 , , '' washington â€” a federal appeals panel on thursday unanimously rejected president trump â€™ s bid to reinstate his ban on travel into the united states from seven largely muslim nations , a sweeping rebuke of the administration â€™ s claim that the courts have no role as a check on the president .
the ruling also rejected mr. trump â€™ s claim that courts are powerless to review a president â€™ s national security assessments .
â€ the decision was handed down by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco .
it also barred visitors from seven nations for up to 90 days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes .
â€œ so the hope of reunification was crushed , and now they will be admitted .
â€ the court also acknowledged â€œ the massive attention this case has garnered at even the most preliminary stages .
â€œ and on the other , the public also has an interest in free flow of travel , in avoiding separation of families , and in freedom from discrimination .
here are some highlights from the ruling : the court summarizes what the case is about at this stage .
eight years ago at this time , 12 of barack obama â€™ s appointments had been confirmed , while 15 of mr. bush â€™ s had been confirmed in 2001 .
nominees have been caught off guard by their need to sell or distance themselves from unusual holdings , like stakes in private equity and hedge funds , family trusts and even professional sports franchises to steer clear of conflicts before taking a government post .
mr. ricketts is the scion of a wealthy family and of the chicago cubs .

prosecutions in these types of cases are rare , and the law is murky , particularly around people involved in presidential transitions .
but , at the very least , openly engaging in policy discussions with a foreign government during a presidential transition is a remarkable breach of protocol .
â€œ it â€™ s just hard to imagine anyone having a substantive discussion with an adversary , particularly if it â€™ s about trying to be reassuring .
â€ ''
among those criticisms was a column headlined â€œ when you can â€™ t stand your candidate , â€ which appeared in may 2016 in the weekly standard .
mr. tillerson had argued strongly for mr. abrams .
senator tom cotton , republican of arkansas who is closely aligned with friends of mr. abrams â€™ and some members of the lobbying group aipac , had been reaching out to democratic senators to impress upon them the importance of mr. abrams receiving senate confirmation .
and they are swinging it .
representative eric swalwell of california , the ranking democrat on the c. i .
a. subcommittee of the house intelligence committee , called it â€œ a crime for someone outside of our government to negotiate with foreign entities on our nation â€™ s behalf .
6 billion , according to an internal report by the department of homeland security that was seen by reuters .
that â€™ s well over the $ 12 billion estimated by mr. trump during the campaign , and the upper bound of $ 15 billion cited by republican leaders in congress .
we can also deduce what he was watching on television : msnbc â€™ s morning joe .
hillary clinton has been slow to emerge after her november defeat .
but there she was on social media thursday night , praising the unanimous decision by a panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals to uphold a nationwide restraining order against mr. trump â€™ s travel ban for seven countries .
then representative tom mcclintock of california had to flee under guard as constituents in roseville demanded to know why he was so bent on repealing the affordable care act .

evola became a darling of italian fascists , and italy â€™ s terrorists of the 1960s and 1970s looked to him as a spiritual and intellectual godfather .
â€œ he at least recognizes that they are there .
his awareness of and reference to evola in itself only reflects that reading .
the article was by milo yiannopoulos , the provocateur who is wildly popular with conservatives on college campuses .
â€œ they may be inclined to sympathize to those causes , but mainly because it annoys the right people .
â€ evola , who has more than annoyed people for nearly a century , seems to be having a moment .
â€œ now he â€™ s available in english , german , russian , serbian , greek , hungarian .
â€ born in 1898 , evola liked to call himself a baron and in later life sported a monocle in his left eye .
the dictator already admired evola â€™ s early writings on race , which influenced the 1938 racial laws restricting the rights of jews in italy .
they also shared his .
â€ as mr. bannon suggested in his speech , mr. putin â€™ s most influential thinker is aleksandr dugin , the ultranationalist russian traditionalist and writer sometimes called â€œ putin â€™ s rasputin .
â€ an intellectual descendant of evola , mr. dugin has called for a â€œ genuine , true , radically revolutionary , and consistent fascist fascism â€ and advocated a theory of â€œ eurasianism â€ â€” which has provided a philosophical framework for mr. putin â€™ s expansionism and meddling in western european politics .

falluja , iraq â€” iraqi forces had taken falluja from the islamic state months before , and sabah rashid was more than ready to return home .
last week , they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat , electricity or running water .
they boiled water on a wood fire .
and they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid .
iraqi and american security officials now fear that if the sunnis of falluja are given no reason to trust the government , they may once again embrace the islamic state , also known as isis and isil .
the seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start .
even with the group mostly driven out , the government faced a widespread lack of trust .
the government tried to keep the militias out of falluja to avoid antagonizing sunni residents .
a visit to falluja by times journalists showed that last summer â€™ s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed , but had reduced others to rubble .
for mr. rashid , the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city .

the electricity sputtered on and off .

they agreed to give up more than $ 9 .
9 million that they received as performance bonuses from 2001 through 2004 , with mr. greenberg paying most of that amount .
but it is a fraction of the more than $ 50 million the state had sought .
the enron and worldcom accounting frauds had shaken corporate boards .
but mr. greenberg was determined to fight his case , and both sides dug in for a long battle .
the trial had been set to resume last month , but was postponed pending the talks .
a 2008 jury verdict against five others was overturned on appeal .
what began as a battle was nasty from the start .
before he brought the charges in may 2005 , mr. spitzer had forced the ouster of mr. greenberg â€™ s son jeffrey as chief executive of the insurance brokerage marsh mclennan after charging it with and receiving kickbacks .
and mr. greenberg complained that mr. spitzer was treating minor infractions , like â€œ foot faults â€ in tennis , as capital crimes .
â€ early in the trial , mr. greenberg admitted to a sometimes active role in formulating the transactions at issue but insisted he had intended for them to comply with accounting rules .
three years after the charges led to mr. greenberg â€™ s ouster , a. i. g. nearly collapsed and needed an $ 185 billion federal rescue .
in the gen re deal struck in 2000 , the company was supposedly paying $ 10 million to get reinsurance from a. i. g. according to testimony by christian m. milton , a former a. i. g. executive .
but a. i. g. arranged to repay the $ 10 million to gen re with a $ 5 million deal fee , he testified .
the state charged that the â€œ secret â€ fee repayment was a sign the reinsurance was bogus , intended mainly to allow a. i. g. to increase reserves by $ 500 million .
but mr. greenberg , who initiated the deal by phoning the gen re chief executive , testified that he was not aware of the repayment plan .
she also described mr. greenberg as â€œ a very manager .
mr. napier was an important prosecution witness in the connecticut trial who in 2005 pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud in the a. i. g. deal .

hong kong â€™ s chief executive , leung expressed sympathy for the victims in a statement , and he asked the territory â€™ s food and health secretary , ko to visit the hospitalized passengers .
the last major arson attack on a subway train in hong kong occurred on jan. 5 , 2004 , when a fire broke out as a train was arriving at the admiralty station .
fourteen people were injured .
he had popular opinion largely on his side â€” a fact the judges appeared to acknowledge in essentially letting him go with a warning .

â€œ we â€™ ll carry on , because it â€™ s necessary , â€ he told the crowd , according to the news agency .
mr. herrou told europe 1 radio friday morning that he is sheltering five migrant minors from sudan and eritrea at his home .

it did so , however , to the chagrin of some other readers .
the public editor â€™ s take : i am in full agreement .
otherwise , taking such bait is just a distraction .
this prompted several readers to ask whether the times could take legal recourse against the president .
there is a convoluted legal argument over how broad .
its job is to cover him , fairly and aggressively .
a line in a column about kirsten gillibrand and the left raised the eyebrows of a couple readers for its perceived sexism .

1038,18461 , '' surging on the riviera , with mario balotelli in tow - the new york times '' , new york times , rory smith,2017-02-10,2017.0,2.0 , , '' nice , france â€” rivÃ¨re accepts the compliment , but rejects the comparison .
sitting in an office at the back of nice â€™ s official club store , though , rivÃ¨re does not indulge the comparison for long .
nice , he is convinced , is different .
if leicester was a wonderful accident , nice â€™ s metamorphosis is entirely by design .
from the outside , it is tempting â€” though misguided â€” to put a specific date on nice â€™ s ascendance : aug. 31 , 2016 ( more on that below ) .
in reality , the club has been growing , slowly and steadily , ever since rivÃ¨re , a real estate magnate , took control in 2011 .
nice â€™ s annual budget is $ 45 million .
monaco â€™ s is three times that , and p. s. g. â€™ s more than 10 times as large .
the spotlight , though , always prefers to fixate on hares , rather than tortoises .
it was only on aug. 31 , when rivÃ¨re confirmed the arrival of mario balotelli , the enigmatic , italian striker , that the rest of the world sat up and took notice of what was happening on the riviera .
the year before , nice had signed an equally tempestuous character , the france winger hatem ben arfa .
the move piqued interest in france , and a degree of curiosity from the rest of europe .
dozens of reporters descended on the riviera .
rivÃ¨re was more confident .
so balotelli took the boy to school in his car , so the boy could feel like a star , and sorted out the problem .
he has scored 11 goals in 18 games though there have been controversies , they have happened to him , rather than because of him : a red card that was later rescinded , and racial abuse directed toward him during a game at bastia .
â€œ when you have a player who is in trouble , the problem is often in the head , not the feet , â€ he continued .
the mountains are an hour away , monte carlo even less .
there are beaches and nightclubs , money and glamour .
all act as competition .
he has always demanded that the style of play be â€œ popular , â€ appealing .
there was even an ice rink installed outside the allianz riviera before christmas .
and everywhere , there are flashes of red and black , ogc nice â€™ s colors , the team â€™ s identity acting as a surrogate for that of the city .
it is a role that rivÃ¨re , and the club as a whole , feel keenly .
in the 86th minute of every home game , it remembers those who were murdered .
but they know that such events can not only put soccer into perspective but , in the aftermath , also lend it a greater significance .
we are like a medicine , for those who love football .

- the new york times , new york times , jack ewing,2017-02-09,2017.0,2.0 , , '' frankfurt â€” germans who never really warmed up to the euro may be able to sleep a little easier .
not that the gold was ever in danger of being stolen , according to the bundesbank , the german central bank , which is in charge of the reserves .
but the bundesbank said on thursday that it had completed a planned transfer of some $ 13 billion in gold bars that for historical reasons had been stored in vaults deep below lower manhattan .
but at least for some germans , many of them nostalgic for the deutsche mark , gold provides reassurance that the embattled euro is underpinned by something tangible .
gold is perceived as trustworthy .
rumors circulated that some of the gold was missing .
that goal has almost been reached , with 48 percent of the gold already in germany .
â€œ it has a kind of fascination .
even as an economist i can feel this .

instead , they are the vehicle through which teams show respect for former players .
this season , for example , the knicks are celebrating their 70th anniversary , and oakley has not been invited to participate in any of the events .
a. players quickly siding with oakley .
even before the knicks wrapped up their loss to the los angeles clippers on wednesday night , the hashtag # freeoakley began to circulate on social media .
a police officer at the manhattan precinct where oakley was being processed stood on the steps and shouted , â€œ free charles oakley ! â€ passing motorists rolled down their windows and complained about how he had been treated .
several n. b .
james called him a legend .
he questioned why any n. b .
the knicks are , by any objective measure , a mess , and miller may be right that they are taking on a toxic reputation around the league .
as he was then removed from the arena , the crowd chanted his name , a moment that may come to symbolize an increasingly disastrous season .
it dismissed his contention that he had done nothing wrong as â€œ pure fiction .
a .
oakley is no stranger to confrontation .
as a player , he once punched charles barkley in the face during a preseason game .
it has become clear , through some of his actions in retirement , that his approach to the game was really who he is .
and that has caused some problems .
in 2010 , he was involved in a scuffle at a las vegas casino that left him with a broken arm .
more recently , after game 7 of last season â€™ s n. b .
friends describe oakley as loyal , generous and protective .
but he is also sensitive to slights , perceived and real .
â€™ â€ he added : â€œ it â€™ s so disrespectful .
i bought my tickets .
oakley recalled a game at the garden last season when he bumped into a former teammate near the court .
â€ on thursday , in an interview on espn radio , oakley apologized for his role in wednesday â€™ s episode .
so does the ego that animates it , both indomitable and irreparably broken .
yes , hollywood â€™ s most fatally narcissistic glamour girl , norma desmond , is back in town , in the revival of andrew lloyd webber â€™ s â€œ sunset boulevard â€ that opened on thursday night .
it is a show that exists almost entirely to let its star blaze to her heart â€™ s content .
but the opulence of john napier â€™ s original designs has been scrubbed away .
don black and christopher hampton â€™ s book is just fine when it hews to the dialogue of the original screenplay .
but â€œ sunset , â€ being a musical , spends most of its time singing , and mr. black and mr. hampton â€™ s lyrics have a way of turning cynicism into taunting schoolyard jingles , with rhymes that land as emphatically as children on hopscotch squares .
( â€œ you know i â€™ m right .
it â€™ s there in black and white .
â€ ) mr. lloyd webber â€™ s music often inhabits a similar zone of singsong insistence , with certain melody lines repeated so often you fear surgery may be necessary to have them removed from your memory .
only the swirling , ominous overtures evoke the shades of noir of franz waxman â€™ s original film score .
on the lam from a collection agency , joe ( michael xavier ) winds up in a scary old mansion at 10086 sunset boulevard , playing editor , house pet and eventually lover to the reclusive miss desmond , a nearly forgotten diva , who is planning her comeback .
mr. xavier is glib , handsome and charmingly .
but he â€™ s lightweight , lacking the tortured conscience that william holden brought to wilder â€™ s movie .
but we â€™ re just marking time until norma â€™ s back .
but ms. close deploys the declarative physical vocabulary of acting to convey a genuine grandeur of spirit and an equally outsize force of will .
her singing voice is reedy and at times .
i won â€™ t even try to describe the brilliant spiderlike dance â€” superhuman and pathetically human â€” with which ms. close concludes the show .
you have to ( and i mean have to ) see it in person .
watching it from its beginning ( when a set worker trains a spotlight on norma â€™ s face ) to its end ( when she steps to the edge of the stage to absorb the applause like an unquenchable sponge ) is to understand with all your senses the addictiveness of stardom .
â€œ feel the magic in the making , â€ sings norma .
you can only nod your head in agreement . ''

inviting animated visualizations and prosaic props ( like apples and colorful lego plastic blocks ) defined him as a funky philosopher rather than a geeky professor .
â€œ where people want to drive is up to them .
â€œ i â€™ m a very serious possibilist .
he also argued vigorously that overpopulation would no longer be problematic as the world grew wealthier and fertility rates declined .

he was the sole doctor for a population of 300 , 000 .
his investigation of a paralytic disease called konzo in the democratic republic of congo , which was determined to be caused by ingesting naturally occurring cyanide in cassava roots , earned him a doctorate from uppsala university .

he â€™ s nude !

brandishing his bubble chart graphics during ted ( technology , entertainment and design ) talks , dr. rosling often capsulized the macroeconomics of energy and the environment in a favorite anecdote about the day a washing machine was delivered to his family â€™ s flat .

â€ although mr. carter , now decades removed from the night in february 1977 when he donned a cardigan sweater and spoke of the country â€™ s â€œ energy problem , â€ remains a keen student of energy policy , the solar project is also an extension of his legacy here .
mr. carter has long shaped plains , where he is known as â€œ mr .
jimmy , â€ and the sunday school teacher â€™ s grin â€” in snapshots , in paintings and in caricature on christmas ornaments and a peanut statue â€” is hard to miss .
the presidential seal graces welcome signs , which are illuminated , fittingly , by solar electricity , and the jimmy carter national historic site has attracted more than 1 .
6 million visitors since 1988 .
it began when a solar firm , solamerica , approached mr. carter â€™ s grandson jason carter about the possibility of installing panels here .
mr. carter , jason carter recalled this week , regularly sent pictures of the construction on the farmland , which he often passed during walks here with his wife , rosalynn .
plains is all because of jimmy carter .
a plurality of georgia â€™ s electric generation jobs are in solar , according to the department of energy .
â€œ but i hope he doesn â€™ t do that .
â€ this week , though , mr. carter â€™ s energy ambitions were decidedly more local when , dressed in jeans with a small mud stain near his left ankle , he alighted from a gray ford pickup truck to see the solar panels again .

you may also be able to save a boatload of money , since public preschools are often as good as their $ 30 , 000 alternatives .

is the class silent ?
( of course , running wild isn â€™ t a good thing either that energy belongs on the playground . )
kids should be quiet , if a bit squirmy , during circle time , when they are gathered around their teacher .
their teacher should be talking with them , not at them .

now , if mothers take breaks at all , it â€™ s often not until their late 30s or early 40s â€” and those who leave are likely to return to the labor force .
most striking , women have become significantly more likely to work into their 60s and even 70s , often full time , according to the analyses .
â€ she added , â€œ women have more education , they â€™ re in jobs that are more fulfilling , and they stay with them .
â€ ( ms. goldin happens to be an example of the phenomenon , as a professor and researcher . )
men â€™ s employment after age 60 has also risen , since about 1994 , but not as steeply as women â€™ s .
the data included surveys that tracked the same women over time in some cases , the researchers studied respondents â€™ income tax and social security records .
and because women are marrying and having babies later , they spend more time pursuing careers first .
that means that even if they take breaks to care of children , they are likely to return to work and to work past a typical retirement age .
the most telling discovery here , according to the harvard researchers , was that women who enjoyed their jobs earlier in life were employed longer , independent of their education or earnings .
college graduates are more likely to work into older age .

â€œ for those who don â€™ t have our back , we â€™ re taking names , â€ she said of america â€™ s allies in her first remarks at the united nations headquarters , and then repurposed it into a hashtag : # takingnames .
for america â€™ s friends in the world , the uncertainty is complicated by not knowing exactly whom to talk to .
yet ms. haley has taken a different posture .
several western envoys breathed a sigh of relief , but not without doubts .
was the inconsistency deliberate , or did it reflect a lack of consensus ?
who is setting united states policy , and whom should they be talking to ?

few people at the united nations need to be on her good list more than the man who heads the world body , antÃ³nio guterres .
republicans in congress have threatened to pull funding .
so mr. guterres must strike a balance between keeping united states officials on board and not being seen as subservient to united states interests .

1071,18497 , '' al jarreau , singer who spanned jazz , pop and r & ampb worlds , dies at 76 - the new york times '' , new york times , margalit fox,2017-02-24,2017.0,2.0 , , '' al jarreau , a versatile vocalist who sold millions of records and won a string of grammys for his work in pop and rb as well as his first love , jazz , died on sunday in los angeles .
he was 76 .
his music incorporated elements of pop , soul , gospel , latin and other genres .
he was also among the performers on a children â€™ s album , â€œ in harmony : a sesame street record .
â€ alwin lopez jarreau was born in milwaukee on march 12 , 1940 , into a musical family .
young al began singing at 4 , harmonizing with his siblings .
mr. jarreau earned a bachelor â€™ s degree in psychology from ripon college in wisconsin in 1962 , and a master â€™ s in vocational rehabilitation from the university of iowa in 1964 .
though advertised as his debut , it was actually his second album .
a decade earlier , mr. jarreau had quietly recorded an album , later released on the bainbridge label under the title â€œ 1965 .
â€ though mr. jarreau took legal action , without success , to block its belated release in 1982 , it is esteemed by jazz connoisseurs today .
appearances on â€œ saturday night live â€ and other television shows raised his profile , as did extensive touring .
in 1981 he had his biggest hit with the song â€œ we â€™ re in this love together , â€ which reached no .
15 on the billboard pop singles chart .
when confronted with its hard , shell in los angeles last june , he wondered : how do you eat it ?
â€ mr. cao â€™ s employer is betting that other chinese diners will figure it out .
it won â€™ t be easy .
first , there is the matter of what â€™ s on the menu : mexican food .
â€œ it â€™ s like a dirty thing that i love taco bell so much , â€ the actress anna kendrick once said on conan o â€™ brien â€™ s talk show , adding , â€œ it has to be under cover of darkness in my car .
in the 1990s , chinese consumers flocked to kfc and other western chains , drawn by their clean bathrooms and â€” a novelty in china at that time .
the once seemingly insatiable appetite for all things foreign has stalled in a marketplace where domestic brands are catching up and consumers are richer , with more choices than ever .
ultimately the bean burrito was booted .
â€ yum has tried taco bell in china before .
â€œ that was a complete disaster .
5 million by regulators in shanghai .
taco bell may be an unlikely restaurant to connect .
â€œ but mexico itself is a developing country , and so many chinese people would wonder why they would have to try mexican food .
the former basketball star shaquille o â€™ neal , who made the famous â€œ taco neck â€ commercial in 1995 , participated in a competition .
diners sat on chairs below surfboards suspended from ceilings .
â€œ if you didn â€™ t tell me , i wouldn â€™ t even know this was mexican food , â€ said zang jing , 30 , a bank clerk , adding that she thought the food was â€œ not bad .
â€ liu xiaoyi , chief editor of a local food guide , said she believed mexican food could take off in china because people are â€œ willing to try new things .
her friend , zhu li , disagreed .
â€œ it â€™ s all over your hands and dripping on the table .
â€ ''
here â€™ s why it â€™ s so hard in practice .
the tax code has been flawed and inefficient for a very long time , precisely because fixing it could be so terribly disruptive .
in a nutshell , the corporate tax issue provides an excellent case study of the problem of â€œ path dependency â€ in public policy .
but that is not what happened .
today , that choice shapes arrangements in every corner of the economy .
the tax has a feature called â€œ border adjustment , â€ under which exports are not taxed but imports are .
that , at first glance , may seem to penalize companies that import goods , like retailers , and subsidize those that export , like makers of jumbo jets .
but according to calculations by michael j. graetz , a columbia law professor , a currency shift of that scale implies that americans who hold foreign assets would lose $ 6 .
1 trillion , and foreign holders of assets in the united states would gain as much as $ 8 .
1 trillion .
oil would become much more expensive , and oil price shocks have helped set off recessions in the past .
politics is not created by competition and ideas , but personalities and maneuvering to get what people want .
but a few months later , the friendly feelings dissolved , and many of the concessions were rescinded .
it has been hard to keep up with the number of lawsuits filed against mr. sam rainsy and other opposition figures over the last 18 months , many involving allegations of criminal defamation against government officials .
salacious telephone conversations involving mr. kem sokha and other opposition lawmakers have also been leaked online and discussed widely in news media .
the most recent recording , released a week ago , involved a man who sounded like mr. sam rainsy bantering with a waitress about her eating and bathing habits .
mr. sam rainsy â€™ s moral authority was also being eroded from within his party .
eventually , the government pardoned him .
mr. phay siphan called the representatives â€œ blind â€ and â€œ ignorant , â€ and he suggested that mr. sam rainsy was taking cues from them .

are our heroes ready to overthrow their tormentors ?
we also lost spencer and olivia , but they were pretty marginal .
daryl and eugene were taken by the saviors , but daryl escaped .
perhaps the more pertinent question is , when will the revolt happen ?
there are also the wolves , a murderous gang that was a real problem last season but hasn â€™ t been a factor in season 7 .
so is that it ?
in the last episode , we saw saviors tending a herd of walkers , which may or may not be the same herd the alexandrians loosed from the quarry at the beginning of season 6 .
or maybe she just needed some me time .
mr. flynn previously had denied that he had any substantive conversations with ambassador sergey i. kislyak , and mr. pence repeated that claim in television interviews as recently as this month .
even the mere discussion of policy â€” and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an american adversary before mr. trump took office â€” represented a remarkable breach of protocol .
such a payment might violate the emoluments clause of the constitution , which prohibits former military officers from receiving money from a foreign government without consent from congress .
mr. flynn originally told mr. pence and others that the call was limited to small talk and holiday pleasantries .
but the conversation , according to officials who saw the transcript of the wiretap , also included a discussion about sanctions imposed on russia after intelligence agencies determined that president vladimir v. putin â€™ s government tried to interfere with the 2016 election on mr. trump â€™ s behalf .
during his 2015 trip to moscow , mr. flynn was paid to attend the anniversary celebration of russia today , a television network controlled by the kremlin .
his survival in the job may hang in the balance .

â€ while mr. mnuchin struggled to show fluency with some aspects of the job during his confirmation hearing , republicans and democrats generally agreed that he was well versed on economic issues .

if the trump organization sold its assets , there would be allegations of impropriety , as foreign investors would most likely be involved .

facing tough questioning at a meeting with the staff , mr. baker denied that the journal had been too soft in its coverage , according to several people who participated in the meeting .
buyouts and layoffs have roiled the staff .
â€œ the reason they â€™ ve been chosen is not because they â€™ re majority muslim but because they â€™ re on the list of countries obama identified as countries of concern .
â€ the discontent among a faction of journalists over coverage of mr. trump stretches back months , according to current and former employees .
the journal â€™ s coverage has also drawn criticism from outside .
in late november , after mr. trump falsely claimed on twitter that â€œ millions of people â€ had voted illegally , the paper was derided online for printing a headline that parroted mr. trump â€™ s assertion without pointing out that it was inaccurate .

at the meetings , he faced crowds that were adversarial but generally civil , and he fielded questions on a range of issues .
â€ the tough questioning of republican lawmakers has been driven partly by concerns over health care , but also by outrage over mr. trump â€™ s presidency .
that was true in wisconsin , too .

â€œ there have been times where we have differed in our approaches , and that â€™ s always been done firmly and respectfully .

it would be silly to credit bill clinton with the boom that took place during his presidency , or to blame george w. bush for the collapse of it .

the woman , fatiha , 18 , was described as having been married against her will and eloping instead with a young man , hedayatullah , believed to be in his early 20s , from a neighboring village in wama district of nuristan province .
but on saturday the police caught and arrested the couple on suspicion of adultery .
â€œ if the police had resisted more , a disaster would have taken place .
the man described by officials and witnesses as the woman â€™ s husband , who was not identified , shot and killed hedayatullah , with whom she had eloped , according to mr. khan .
hedayatullah was described as a member of the national directorate of security , afghanistan â€™ s paramilitary intelligence service , who was stationed in the village .
the nuristan case recalled a 2014 case in which a young couple from bamian province eloped to escape an arranged marriage , but last year fled to asylum in the united states to escape family retribution .
they claimed to be married but the police could tell they were from different districts and therefore did not believe them , according to mr. kamparwal â€™ s account .
once word reached the families of the woman and her husband that she was being held , they formed the mob that stormed the police station , according to the authorities .
the district is in a part of a province where the taliban also have some control .

mr. wang has been down the â€™ n â€™ route before , and while he has a knack for combining the trappings of punk with some neat men â€™ s wear tailoring and couture cuts , here the latter was unfortunately in short supply .

social media recently took it upon itself to answer that question , after a brief flurry of rumors about a possible white house dress code .

face to face with f. b. i. agents , he was grilled about a phone call he had had with russia â€™ s ambassador .
but rarely has an official at such a high level risen and fallen in such a dizzyingly short time , in this case just 24 days after mr. flynn arrived in the west wing to take his corner office .
â€œ there were no lines crossed .
â€ the issue traced back to a call last december between mr. flynn , then on tap to become mr. trump â€™ s national security adviser , and sergey i. kislyak , the russian ambassador to the united states .
that caught the attention of the f. b. i. and the justice department .
it was not clear whether mr. flynn had a lawyer for his interview or whether anyone at the white house knew the interview was happening .
jared kushner , the president â€™ s and senior adviser , had expressed concern about mr. flynn â€™ s appointment even before the inauguration , according to another person briefed on the discussions .
â€œ he loves mattis because mattis is respectful and .
the situation escalated late thursday when word reached the white house that the washington post was reporting that the transcript of mr. flynn â€™ s call showed that he had discussed sanctions , contrary to his assurances to mr. pence and others .

but he would also have to contend with mr. trump â€™ s inner circle , populated by political advisers with whom mr. harward is not familiar , including steven k. bannon , the chief white house strategist .
they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on mr. harward â€™ s behalf .
â€œ you rock !

â€œ you rock more !

in his resignation letter , mr. flynn â€œ sincerely apologized â€ to mr. pence and mr. trump , blaming the fast pace of events for what he called his â€œ incomplete â€ account .
â–  mr. flynn had multiple conversations with russia â€™ s ambassador to the united states , sergey i. kislyak , before and after mr. trump â€™ s november victory .
â–  the justice department told the white house about the contents of mr. flynn â€™ s conversation with mr. kislyak , which had been recorded by a government wiretap .

the missile program has been a major concern for the pentagon , which has developed options for how to respond , including deploying additional missile defenses in europe or developing or cruise missiles .
it is very unlikely that the senate , which is already skeptical of president vladimir v. putin â€™ s intentions , would agree to ratify a new strategic arms control accord unless the alleged violation of the treaty is corrected .
â€ but at the same time , he has talked of reaching a new arms agreement with moscow that would reduce arms â€œ very substantially .
jim mattis , the united states defense secretary , is scheduled to meet with allied defense ministers in brussels on wednesday .
as a result of the agreement , russia and the united states destroyed 2 , 692 missiles .
â€ russia began testing the cruise missile as early as 2008 .
after years of frustration , the united states convened a november 2016 meeting in geneva of a special verification commission established under the treaty to deal with compliance issues .
it was the first meeting in 13 years of the commission , whose members include the united states , russia and three former soviet republics that are also party to the accord : belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine .
having failed to persuade the russians to fix the alleged violation , some military experts say , the united states needs to ratchet up the pressure by announcing plans to expand missile defenses in europe and deploy or nuclear missiles .
but he cautioned against responding in kind by seeking to deploy new american nuclear missiles in europe .

needham , 35 , is the chief executive of heritage action for america , a feral cur of a lobbying organization established by the venerable conservative think tank in 2010 to ( as its website puts it ) â€œ hold congress accountable to conservative principles .
his youthful acquaintance with struggle was limited to being a mets fan .
by the time obamacare was signed into law in march 2010 , needham had again temporarily left heritage , attending stanford business school and dating a democrat whom he would later marry .
â€ and though it may appear otherwise in a dawning age of republican on government , the argument is today far from over .
â€œ the joke around washington , â€ the former democratic congressman jim mcdermott told me , â€œ is that the republicans are going to repeal obamacare â€” and they â€™ ll replace it with the affordable care act .
it was here , in 1989 , that the intellectual framework was first developed for what would become the affordable care act .
what obama and the congress ultimately settled on was a framework of health care exchanges â€” marketplaces where health insurance could be purchased , and had to be , if you weren â€™ t already covered .
you have to tell them what you â€™ re for .
on march 21 , 2010 , the house finally passed on a vote a version of the bill that was sure to be agreed to by the senate .
â€ the day after obama signed the bill into law , a republican backbencher from iowa named steve king drafted his own bill in the house to repeal it in its entirety .
heritage action , they informed jackson , intended to push house members to sign king â€™ s petition .
we let off on the gas .
â€ as both chapman and needham today concede , jackson might also have had his own â€œ aha â€ moment , recognizing them as impudent young jerks .
â€ among republican elected officials , the heritage foundation had long been regarded as a tweedy grandfather , revered but not feared .
the think tank was proficient at spewing out white papers and keynote speeches .
now , with heritage action as a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) â€œ social welfare organization , â€ the foundation at last had its own squad in the fight .
and in needham , feulner had a lieutenant whose job , as feulner put it , would be â€œ to run the flag up the flagpole and see who salutes .
and that is frankly a distraction .
but king was also a tenacious conservative .
on june 16 , he introduced his discharge petition , and heritage action began sending out emails to the foundation â€™ s 661 , 000 members , urging them to pressure representatives on both sides of the aisle to sign it â€” ominously adding in a news release that â€œ those who fail to support this effort are responsible for obamacare .
a month later , heritage action turned up the heat on the 34 democrats â€” most of them conservative blue dogs â€” who voted against obamacare in march but had yet to sign king â€™ s discharge petition .
â€ in september , a single democrat , gene taylor of mississippi , added his signature .
but though the discharge petition had stalled , king and heritage action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and , eventually , an .
overall , those who pledged fealty to repealing obamacare fared better that november than those who didn â€™ t .
there were 53 of them when obamacare passed .
during the 2010 midterm election cycle , opponents of the a. c. a. spent $ 108 million on ads pillorying it .
none of them stood any chance of becoming a law â€” they were dead on arrival in the senate .
â€ at times , however , what looked like the â€œ right thing â€ was , from needham â€™ s vantage , in fact the wrong thing .
in april 2011 , for example , a bill dismantling part of obamacare did clear the house and then the senate , and was signed into law by president obama without hesitation .
but heritage action , because of its ironclad resistance to â€œ partial repeal , â€ actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision .
or let â€™ s fix the issue â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ â€” the popular shorthand for an a. c. a. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week .
needham also began issuing scorecards on how frequently members of congress were voting down spending bills .
representative rob wittman of virginia was taken to task in a heritage action analysis for casting only four of a potential 11 votes to cut spending during a series of roll calls he had to inform chapman that he had missed those votes because his father had died .
â€ but heritage action had other defenders besides feulner .
mick mulvaney of south carolina , a rising star in the tea party class of 2010 , characterized heritage action â€™ s messaging as â€œ invaluable .
as a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) heritage action was not obliged to disclose its finances , but it was known to have received millions , including $ 500 , 000 from the koch brothers .
the a. c. a .
it was a glum axiom among conservatives that once americans were handed a new entitlement â€” social security , medicare , medicaid , food stamps , unemployment insurance â€” they were loath to part with it .
moreover , once a gigantic program fully insinuates itself into the federal governing apparatus , disentangling it is a formidable task .
senate democrats objected , but house republicans wouldn â€™ t budge .
the shutdown was the crisis point heritage action had hoped for â€” that cherished moment when republicans finally took a bold , principled stand .
republicans in both the house and the senate would stand firm .
or so needham and chapman hoped .
the others in the room stared at him with a welling resentment .
we â€™ ve shut the government down .
but what does heritage action intend to do to put pressure on the democrats ?
within days , the republicans in the senate buckled and , with the house republican leaders in tow , signed a deal with obama that said almost nothing about health care .
â€ a month later , on the â€œ tonight â€ show , he called the government shutdown a â€œ predictable disaster .
the congressional action was viewed more as sour grapes and not altogether realistic .
as oct. 1 , 2013 â€” the date healthcare .
gov was to be open for enrollments â€” approached , little time was available to subject the website to tests that could expose its shortcomings .
by this time , the republican critique of obamacare was already becoming a prophecy .
from 2011 through 2014 , as the house republicans played round after round of fiscal brinkmanship , obama reluctantly signed budget deals that continually shortchanged obamacare .
as a bonus for needham and chapman , eric cantor , the house majority leader had been drubbed in the primary by a tea republican .
that threshold was attainable , now that the republicans had 54 senate seats .
heritage action announced its strong disapproval of the reconciliation bill , instructed members to vote it down and warned that the measure would be .
the new speaker of the house , paul ryan , ignored heritage action .
â€ the senate republicans did .
on jan. 8 , 2016 , he vetoed it .
the affordable care act â€™ s approval rating has rarely exceeded 50 percent .
4 billion of the $ 6 billion originally appropriated to establish them .
another 3 million americans under the age of 26 have been allowed to stay on their parents â€™ health care plans , thanks to the provision in the a. c. a. that heritage action warmly refers to as the â€œ slacker mandate .
the bill has not proved to be the â€œ job killer â€ apocalyptically described by its republican opponents .
now that the law is in place , trying to tinker with it in a measured fashion , deciding which parts to discard and which to keep , would be more complicated than simply determining what the public likes and what it doesn â€™ t .
i don â€™ t really recall any time when that has happened in our economy on any issue .
â€ collectively , those groups spent close to $ 273 million on lobbying during the height of the obamacare debate .
they will surely spend a similar sum haranguing congress to pass a replacement that favors them .
at the same time , the fitful and at times rhetorically muddled transition from the known ( obamacare ) to the unknown ( â€œ something terrific â€ ) has risked throwing the health care industry into turmoil .
the aftershocks are likely to be not only economic but also political .
to king and heritage action , failing to seize this moment of opportunity would constitute a grave betrayal .
the rest of the public has begun a decided turn against king â€™ s and heritage action â€™ s position .
the same fox news poll last month that found obamacare â€™ s overall favorability to be 50 percent also found that only 23 percent of respondents favored fully repealing it â€” a new low since the law was signed nearly seven years ago .
â€œ i â€™ m concerned when i hear that kind of talk , â€ king had told me .
what â€™ s the overused phrase ?
trump supporters take him seriously , not literally .
â€œ we â€™ re probably in an age where smaller , humbler pieces of legislation are easier to get consensus around .
â€ this struck me as sensible and , at the same time , somewhat naÃ¯ve .
if , as in heritage action â€™ s dream scenario , obamacare were to be immediately vaporized , it would leave a yawning vacuum â€” and the first thing to fill it would be anxiety .
it was a pleasing image , conveying undying fellowship .
or maybe washington would prove , hardly for the first time , that even the best of friends will let you down . ''
â€ the outcome was a victory for the manhattan district attorney , cyrus r. vance jr. who chose to prosecute mr. hernandez a second time after the earlier mistrial .
â€ mr. hernandez , 56 , is scheduled to be sentenced on feb. 28 .
as part of his confession , he also signed a â€œ missing â€ poster showing etan , confirming to investigators that he was the boy he had attacked .
â€œ i felt like something just took over me .
the defense contended that mr. hernandez â€™ s admissions reflected a fiction he had concocted .
they also argued that he was susceptible to pressure by detectives during an interrogation that lasted several hours .
mr. hernandez , who stared forward blankly through much of the trial , showed little emotion as the verdict was announced .
â€ prosecutors sought to portray mr. hernandez as mercurial and controlling yet deeply religious and desperate to unburden himself of the guilt he felt for attacking etan .
the first prosecution witness to testify when the trial began in october was julie patz .
she recounted a hectic morning and what turned out to be her final moments with her son .
his lawyers depicted mr. hernandez as struggling with a mental illness that loosened his grip on reality .
his youngest daughter , becky , testified that he had discussed having hallucinations of demons and an angelic woman in white .
the defense also suggested that another man could have been the culprit .
prosecutors , citing a lack of evidence , dismissed the suggestion that mr. ramos was involved .
â€œ we all had different hangups , â€ ms. kiernan told reporters .
â€œ it â€™ s not a case .
there â€™ s a lot of gray .
â€ ultimately , the jurors agreed with the prosecution â€™ s arguments discrediting mr. ramos as a potential suspect , and found that the defense had not raised enough doubt .

1119,18551 , can immigration hurt the economy ?
an old prejudice returns - the new york times , new york times , eduardo porter,2017-02-15,2017.0,2.0 , , '' for a nation of immigrants , the united states has worked hard to keep foreigners out .
it barred immigration from most of asia .
and it limited immigrants from other countries to 2 percent of the number of people of that country â€™ s ancestry in the united states in 1890 â€” restricting immigration mostly to people from northern and western europe .
this time , suspicion is being buttressed by some economists with a proposition not too dissimilar to laughlin â€™ s : that immigrants could sap america â€™ s vitality by bringing inferior cultural traits from their dysfunctional home countries to erode american social norms .
it â€™ s an unsettling assertion .
countries that receive them run the risk â€œ that the social model will become blended in such a way that damagingly dilutes its functionality .
it is true that people from other countries sometimes carry sketchy norms with them .
this may suggest that their productivity may not match that of previous waves of immigrants .
the growing wage gap identified by professor borjas may relate to things other than the immigrants â€™ own qualities â€” like rising income inequality in the united states .
is there a threshold where further immigration starts doing real damage ?
how close is the united states to it ?
what is the mechanism whereby productivity in the united states might be reduced by immigrants â€™ weaker attributes ?
and immigration may actually improve the institutions of the countries immigrants go to .
but the case has nothing to do with contagion .

so i asked some flower experts and tried my own ( not very scientific ) homegrown experiment .
to start , i bought nine stalks of chrysanthemums from a grocery store and put each stalk in a clean glass bottle with about 12 ounces of warm water and the following common treatments : â€¢ water alone â€¢ water and putting flowers in a refrigerator every night â€¢ sprite ( Â¼ cup ) and water â€¢ vinegar ( 1 tbsp . )
sugar ( 1 tbsp . )
and water â€¢ vodka ( â…› tsp . )
sugar ( 1 tsp . )
and water â€¢ aspirin ( 1 crushed ) and water â€¢ penny , sugar ( 1 tsp . )
and water â€¢ bleach ( 2 drops ) sugar ( 1 tsp . )
and water â€¢ flower food ( Â½ packet ) and water there â€™ s some science behind these methods .
it likely has the right blend of antibacterial agents , a sugar source for food and an acidifier that will extend the life of your arrangement .
let â€™ s rewind first , to the moment you receive a fresh bouquet .
before you even put your flowers in water , there are a couple of things you should do .
remove any leaves or florets that would sit in the water , because those will cause bacterial buildup .
change the water at least once a week , recutting the stems and adding more preservative or food each time .
copper , bleach and vinegar are antibacterial , and refrigerating should slow water loss and the breakdown of tissues .
the flowers in the penny solution also looked good , though the water appeared slightly cloudy , likely because the copper didn â€™ t dissolve enough to provide any antimicrobial effects .
while the bouquets in aspirin and vinegar sagged , all the other flowers appeared robust , even in plain water .
â€œ their petals aren â€™ t as tough and waxy , so they lose a lot of water and wilt fast .
â€ of course , even if you pull out all the stops , you won â€™ t be able to ward off the inevitable .
so , smell your roses while they last . ''
but there are limits to mr. gatshan â€™ s thankfulness .
â€œ i want my human rights .

and the palestinians remain sharply divided : the palestinian authority , backed by the united states and european powers , governs parts of the west bank , while hamas , a militant islamist movement committed to israel â€™ s destruction , rules the coastal gaza strip .
â€œ in the end , the occupation has to end , or you will have no end to the conflict .
egypt , too , has turned inward , as its economy has worsened and a jihadist insurgency has taken root on the sinai peninsula .
that causes â€œ a sense of helplessness â€ toward the palestinian issue .
on monday , it announced that yehya sinwar , a member of its military wing , had been chosen as its new gaza leader .

latin america â€™ s biggest corruption scandal is shaking the continent â€™ s political establishment .
5 billion under the foreign corrupt practices act for an elaborate bribe scheme involving $ 800 million in payoffs in exchange for lucrative contracts .
nearly three years of investigations have resulted in 77 brazilian odebrecht executives signing plea deals , and the company â€™ s former chief executive , marcelo odebrecht , is in prison .
yet she called it a positive development for the region , showing â€œ the anticorruption movement in latin america is gaining ground .
mr. toledo â€™ s whereabouts was unknown , and peruvians have been captivated .
in lima , the capital , the legacy of odebrecht is hard to miss .
but odebrecht has also reaped the benefits of its connections to the country .
5 billion , four times over budget .
the overruns were approved by an official who is also under investigation by prosecutors .
under ollanta humala , mr. kuczynski â€™ s predecessor , odebrecht began a $ 7 billion natural gas pipeline to connect the amazon to the coast by cutting through the andes mountains .
but she added , â€œ i think this is an important moment to think about our ability to institutionalize the fight against corruption .
6 million in bribes for various projects in colombia , including a road linking the country â€™ s interior to the magdalena river and caribbean highway known as the ruta del sol .
ivan garzÃ³n , a political scientist at colombia â€™ s university of la sabana , said odebrecht had shown how easy it was to hijack the country â€™ s elections for its own gain .
in venezuela , the authorities seem to be taking a different tack toward the revelations : cracking down on outsiders trying to investigate them .
the brazilian journalists were later deported .
it â€™ s a time of candlelit dinners , candy boxes from the drugstore and ( depending on your relationship status ) watching old romantic comedies while you drink wine by yourself .
people have been trying to answer those questions for a long time .
â€ there is little reliable information about the life of st. valentine .
st. valentine was later beheaded for his religious zeal , a death that roman men decided to celebrate by pulling the names of eligible young ladies out of an urn .
not everyone is convinced of that version of events .
chaucer may have connected st. valentine to romance because it was convenient : his saint â€™ s day , on feb. 14 , took place at a time when britons in the 14th century thought spring began , with birds starting to mate and plants beginning to bloom , mr. oruch wrote .
from chaucer â€™ s perspective , an added perk was that europeans at the time thought â€œ valentine â€ was a name .
it â€™ s a compelling theory , but mr. oruch knew it was tough to compete with popular stories about romantic romans .
â€ it â€™ s also a day to spend money .
2 billion , or an average $ 136 .
so , what if your only valentine happens to be your cat ?

1132,18564 , should athletes stick to sports ?
- the new york times , new york times , jay caspian kang,2017-02-18,2017.0,2.0 , , '' for the past few months , the sports media has been embroiled in a fight over â€œ stick to sports .
the settled politics of the past , where details can be kept few and the tone nostalgic , are fine .
we know , for example , that jackie robinson broke baseball â€™ s color line , stole home and wore 42 on his back .
billie jean king beat bobby riggs .
their lionization reassures us that the stands they took were good â€” and can now be consigned to bygone eras .
but the latest intrusion of political talk into sports â€” whether you deem it excessive or welcome â€” has had a drastic effect on coverage .
the day the white house declared its immigration and travel ban in january , the milwaukee bucks played the toronto raptors in canada , and there was some concern that the bucks â€™ rookie center , thon maker , would not be let back into the united states after the game : maker is a citizen of australia , but his family emigrated there from sudan .

he owned a team in the united states football league ( while almost running the league into the ground ) he hosted fights at his atlantic city casinos he tried to buy the buffalo bills he brags about his friendship with brady .
above all , he has shown a crippling sensitivity to the opinions of his fellow celebrities .
professional sports usually provides a poor , inaccurate reflection of politics , but sometimes elements of that imagery â€” the machismo , the posturing , the adoration of stars â€” align exactly .
â€œ i didn â€™ t listen .
i wasn â€™ t kind .
i cheated .
â€ mr. rock paused as the audience waited for the joke .
it is rare to see a celebrity discuss his infidelity with the specificity that he did here â€” detailing who and how many â€” but he talked about this in an anguished , searching tone that fans may find surprising .
at times , mr. rock sounded like a man confessing his sins , turning vulnerability into his latest provocation .
his current show will be released as a special on netflix , part of a $ 40 million deal .
his last , â€œ kill the messenger , â€ was recorded during the 2008 election , and it â€™ s hard not to be struck by his cheerful mood then , sounding positively giddy as he pokes fun at john mccain , skewering him as a â€œ war hero who got captured .
but mr. rock didn â€™ t try to adjust to it .
â€œ i â€™ m black .
the rise of mr. trump , he concluded , taking his critique to a comic extreme , stems from our battle against bullying .
â€ but he also spent time sympathizing with police officers , describing work that has zero room for error and draws pay that is far too low .
if his current social commentary has a common thread , it â€™ s an alertness to how economics colors every issue .
â€œ but a $ 7 orange does .
â€ what stood out most about this show , however , was the personal , not the political .
he isn â€™ t the type to dwell on his demons or soul search on a podcast .
not hugs .
he also dug into his past , telling a story about his grandmother disparaging poor men that stuck with him for years , and another about his grandfather mocking him for crying .
onstage , mr. rock has always had the intonations of a preacher â€” which his grandfather was â€” repeating premises until they sound like incantations .
what â€™ s different is he now sounds more anxious .
and while the election and his divorce may have added heaviness to his gait , this evolution may also stem from simply growing older .

1134,18566 , south korea â€™ s olympian winter moment - the new york times , new york times , justin bergman,2017-02-16,2017.0,2.0 , , '' emerging from the warmth of her car , jung watched her husband trudge up a snowy hill , red sled in hand , as their son bounded excitedly ahead , ready for another run .
like many young south koreans in the congested capital of seoul , she and her husband escape to the nearby taebaek mountains to hit the slopes several times each winter , though she admitted they are still trying to find their legs as skiers .
â€ there â€™ s another draw that keeps their son enthralled â€” a indoor water park called ocean 700 , whose attractions include a wave pool , a lazy river filled with bobbing and a waterslide with the slightly intimidating name of tornado .
â€œ it â€™ s very popular in korea .
maybe even more than the skiing .
pyeongchang , largely unfamiliar even to many koreans before the olympic bid , was once seen as a sizable underdog to win the olympics .
it finally succeeded in its third bid after defeats to vancouver in 2010 and sochi in 2014 .
to avoid confusion with the north korean capital of pyongyang , the olympic host was officially rebranded from its original name , pyongchang , to pyeongchang , adding an â€œ e â€ and capital â€œ c .
the preparations have also been rocky .
( the organizing committee has done damage control by promising to replant trees and return the mountain to its natural state after the games . )
the streets are lined with homey dumpling and korean fried chicken restaurants , as well as nondescript clothing stores with names like barbie fashion shop that stock sweaters and windbreakers , but nary a ski jacket in sight .
a small truck with a squawking loudspeaker makes the rounds in the afternoons selling fresh crab and squid from the coast , and on the outskirts of town , locals hang pollock on wooden racks for days in the winter sun until they become tough as leather , a popular korean delicacy called hwangtae .
it may take some time to catch up to its neighbors .
4 million in to a peak of 6 .
8 million in but then fell to just 4 .
9 million in in part because of a slowing economy and an aging population .
though the downturn has hit some resorts hard , the attractions in japan are still legion : resorts with dozens of trails and steep verticals a lengthy ski season that sometimes stretches into early may a raucous scene ( particularly popular among australians ) and above all , the endlessly falling snow .
in china , meanwhile , skiing is also booming among the newly rich and young urban dwellers , with more than 12 .
5 million resort visits registered in .
china is sure to attract even more investment as it gears up for its own winter olympics in beijing in 2022 .
safety and proper decorum , not speed , also seem to be paramount concerns â€” fences prevent skiers from going helmets are ubiquitous , and signs constantly remind visitors to select the appropriate slope for their skill level and slow down .
â€ then there â€™ s the cool factor .
and just like the broader korean wave sweeping asia in music , television and film , korean brands are now at the forefront of snowboarding style in the region , too .
these fashions are perhaps most visible at the welli hilli park , a snowboarder â€™ s paradise about an hour â€™ s drive from yongpyong .
( a clear violation of the rules , mind you . )
â€ mr. kim fancies himself a skiing purist â€” most of the time .
â€œ i just like an outfit i feel comfortable in .
korean resorts are decidedly with few entertainment options after sundown .
at the alpensia resort , a small , facility that â€™ s within minutes of most olympic venues and will serve as the focal point for the games , the only options are a karaoke parlor , a pool hall and a charmingly rustic bar with hite beer on tap and a dozen varieties of chicken , from soy sauce chicken to a curiously named â€œ cheese chicken .
â€ then again , there are some advantages to a quieter ski destination .
â€ the olympics information about the 2018 olympics in pyeongchang is available at pyeongchang2018 .
.
until then , both yongpyong and alpensia resorts have shuttles that leave from the airport several times a day ( 70 , 000 korean won round trip , or about $ 60 ) .
a lift ticket is 69 , 000 won and rentals are 29 , 000 won for skis and 35 , 000 won for snowboards .
a lift ticket is 76 , 000 won and rental is 33 , 000 won .
welli hilli sells lift tickets for 70 , 000 won .

mr. friedman , an orthodox jewish bankruptcy lawyer from long island , has rejected the internationally accepted solution for the conflict .
archaeological excavations in the area have found signs of ancient life .
the palestinian village of beitin sits on a nearby hill .
a charismatic former member of the israeli parliament from a party , mr. katz , a staunch nationalist , is credited with building up the network in the united states and bringing in tens of millions of dollars .
when mr. friedman â€™ s nomination was announced , mr. katz praised him on his facebook page as a pioneering philanthropist and settlement builder .
but the yeshiva complex is a multitentacled enterprise .
arutz sheva , which caters to israel â€™ s nationalist camp , started out as a pirate radio station broadcasting from a ship acquired by mr. katz .

but he is a mystery to most middle eastern officials .
his exposure to the arab world amounts to little more than trips to a handful of persian gulf countries and a jaunt to jordan .
his grandmother survived the holocaust by crawling through a homemade tunnel in poland .
his family used its real estate fortune to donate millions of dollars to american jewish and israeli hospitals , schools and other institutions , including a few in settlements , according to public records .
â€ through a white house spokeswoman , mr. kushner declined to respond or be interviewed .
â€ mr. kushner â€™ s religious upbringing may have been intense , but his high school yearbook message was with an ode to his sneakers .
in eighth grade , their class was stunned by the killing of ilana â€™ s older sister , alisa , in a bus bombing in the gaza strip .
in 1996 , a recent graduate named sara duker was killed in another bus bombing , sending shock waves through the school again .
there was little discussion of what it was like to live under occupation , several classmates of mr. kushner â€™ s recalled .
â€œ there was such a strange blindness to the complexity of the situation .
mr. kushner sometimes expressed his views during long sabbath meals at the house .
he didn â€™ t believe that israel needed â€œ the approval of europe , the united nations or even washington or london , â€ the rabbi continued .
he took out loans for the real estate business from israel â€™ s bank hapoalim and almost bought a major israeli insurance company called phoenix .
it is unclear what shape mr. kushner â€™ s role will take , especially as figures like secretary of state rex w. tillerson and others in the foreign policy apparatus become engaged in middle eastern diplomacy .
â€œ the strange thing is , that kid may end up being the in the room .

on the russian side , the contacts also included members of the government outside of the intelligence services , they said .

the officials declined to identify the other trump associates on the calls .
mr. manafort , who has not been charged with any crimes , dismissed the officials â€™ accounts in a telephone interview on tuesday .
it is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with mr. trump himself .
the intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between michael t. flynn , mr. trump â€™ s former national security adviser , and sergey i. kislyak , russia â€™ s ambassador to the united states .

all of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with russian officials .

â€œ but the more serious question is whether our nation â€™ s intelligence services were involved in what amounts to political espionage against the newly elected government .

even as the department of health and human services worked to answer insurance company concerns , the internal revenue service and congress were taking steps that could add uncertainty to the jittery insurance economy .
on capitol hill , conservatives declared that they are not about to accept a health law replacement that remotely resembles the affordable care act .
it threatened to drop out if its concerns about a program requiring the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to other insurers were not addressed .
the rules also would require consumers to provide â€œ supporting documentation â€ to prove they were eligible to enroll in health plans through healthcare .
insurers have told the government for several years that people who sign up in a special enrollment period use up to 50 percent more services than those who sign up in the regular enrollment season .
final rules are likely to be issued in march or april .
insurers must decide by early may what kinds of health plans they will offer in 2018 .
â€ the government can deduct the amount of any penalty from refunds that would otherwise be sent to taxpayers .
â€ but mr. flynn â€™ s departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 pennsylvania avenue .
his words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country .
â€œ i â€™ ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in washington , â€ said leon panetta , a democrat who served as chief of staff , secretary of defense and c. i .

on monday , mr. kim , 45 , met his end at kuala lumpur international airport in malaysia .
it was also unclear how many people were involved in the attack .
the royal malaysia police announced late wednesday afternoon that they had arrested a woman that morning and that she had been carrying a vietnamese passport in terminal 2 , where the attack occurred .

â€ mr. kim was born in secret , and when his mother fell out of favor with kim and was forced to live in moscow , he was left in the care of her sister .
( his mother was alone in moscow when she died in 2002 . )
according to a japanese sushi chef who published a 2003 memoir about his experience working for the kim family , kim was by that time the father â€™ s favorite .
kim squandered what little chance he may have had to succeed his father when he embarrassed pyongyang in 2001 he was caught trying to enter japan on a fake passport from the dominican republic .

but the threat of catastrophic flooding from the damaged oroville dam in northern california this week â€” forcing the evacuation of nearly 200 , 000 people because of what environmental groups had asserted in 2005 was a design flaw â€” presented a warning sign for california , where a network of dams and waterways is suffering from age and stress .

depending on which show you viewed , it â€™ s fine for men to sport blue feather boas or fishnet shirts with a bow ( jeremy scott ) .
or for women and men to wear virtually interchangeable clothes , in restrained , minimalist androgyny ( raf simons for calvin klein ) .

women have long appropriated men â€™ s clothes for comfort and authority .

cut ?
accessories ?
fashion , like society , is clearly not opting for hard and fast rules .
his first collection for calvin klein was also the first time the house showed both men â€™ s and women â€™ s lines in the same show .
in this show , much of the men â€™ s and women â€™ s clothing looked all but identical there were a few times when it was hard to figure out whether the model was a man or a woman .
there were glen plaid suits with blazers and black leather jackets with silver rose cutouts for men and women .
the pants and varsity stripe motifs were echoed in the men â€™ s and women â€™ s clothes .
but he did not overtly cross gender lines by putting men in skirts .
for public school , the designers chow and maxwell osborne took street motifs often associated with men â€” parkas , puffers , hoodies , anoraks â€” and toyed with how to dress women in them .
the puffers for women were a surprisingly sensual look for a normally unisex coat the men in the show wore the puffers short , not big or baggy .
at public school , a man walked out in a plaid shirt and slightly baggy pants with a zipper , followed by a woman wearing the same plaid shirt as a dress with a navy train .
men and women wore his signature jesus motif coats with leopard accents â€” the women â€™ s coats tighter , the men â€™ s looser .
in the end , designers ran the gamut , from blurring the lines between men and women to embracing them , sometimes in the same collection .
in other words , they were perfect casting for new york fashion week â€” presuming they could get seats to a show .
a reporter â€™ s initial plan was to take them to raf simons â€™ s debut at calvin klein , but with just 400 seats in the house and no calvin klein available for them to wear , the request was declined .
they almost didn â€™ t get into tory burch either , until ms. burch and her team agreed to dress ms. gray and seat her with mr. steele in the front row at her show tuesday morning , which took place at the whitney museum in lower manhattan .
had so few people in the fashion industry read the rapturous reviews in the new york times , variety and the hollywood reporter ?
mr. steele wore his own vintage black leather jacket , with a borrowed burgundy and black shirt , borrowed black slacks and borrowed black and red loafers from allsaints .
behind them was a stylist named michael fusco .
â€œ it was a wonderful evening .

but we â€™ re not going to let it happen , because i â€™ m here again , to take my message straight to the people .
to be honest , i inherited a mess .
it â€™ s a mess .
at home and abroad , a mess .
the middle east is a disaster .
i just want to let you know , i inherited a mess .
we have had great conversations with the united kingdom , and meetings .
we have the greatest people on earth in our military , but they don â€™ t have the right equipment and their equipment is old .
depleted , it â€™ s depleted â€” it won â€™ t be depleted for long .
we have to have a strong law enforcement also .
so we do not go abroad in the search of war , we really are searching for peace , but its peace through strength .
some of the things i â€™ m doing probably aren â€™ t popular but they â€™ re necessary for security and for other reasons .
i â€™ m here following through on what i pledged to do .
that â€™ s all i â€™ m doing .
270 which you need , that was laughable .
and â€” but a lot of people are happy about it .
chaos .
yet it is the exact opposite .
how do you not approve him ?
he â€™ s been a colleague â€” highly respected .
we â€™ re waiting for approval .
let me list to you some of the things that we â€™ ve done in just a short period of time .
we â€™ ve withdrawn from the disaster known as trans pacific partnership .
and then at the end of the process â€” they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process , they get rejected .
now , they may be rejected with me but it â€™ s going to be a quick rejection .
we don â€™ t want the jobs going to other countries .
we â€™ ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers .
nobody â€™ s ever seen regulations like we have .
but you don â€™ t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing .
we â€™ ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in america , including the horrendous situation â€” take a look at chicago and others , taking place right now in our inner cities .
horrible .
we are not going to let it happen any longer .
we have taken decisive action to keep radical islamic terrorists out of our country .
i will not back down from defending our country .
i think that circuit is â€” that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil .
we have also taken steps to begin construction of the keystone pipeline and dakota access pipelines .
thousands and thousands of jobs , and put new buy american measures in place to require american steel for american pipelines .
to drain the swamp of corruption in washington , d. c. i â€™ ve started by imposing a lobbying ban on white house officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government .
we â€™ ve begun preparing to repeal and replace obamacare .
obamacare is a disaster , folks .
it is â€™ s disaster .
so we â€™ ve begun preparing to repeal and replace obamacare , and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back , to bring our jobs back to this country .
he â€™ s out there negotiating right now .
mick is with us now .
among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens .
not free , fair .
if a country is taking advantage of us , not going to let that happen anymore .
every country takes advantage of us almost .
i may be able to find a couple that don â€™ t .
but for the most part , that would be a very tough job for me to do .
jobs have already started to surge .
since my election , ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in mexico , and will instead invest $ 700 million in michigan , creating many , many jobs .
fiat chrysler announced it will invest $ 1 billion in ohio and michigan , creating 2 , 000 new american jobs .
they were with me a week ago .
you know you were here .
and these jobs and these things that i â€™ m announcing would never have come here .
walmart announced it will create 10 , 000 jobs in the united states just this year because of our various plans and initiatives .
other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades â€” decades , and decades , and decades , folks .
and we â€™ re not going to let that happen anymore .
not going to let it happen .
you may not see that .
this last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country .
that starts early next week .
and with that , i just say , god bless america , and let â€™ s take some questions .
that â€™ s the real problem .
i called , as you know , mexico .
it was a very , very confidential , classified call .
but i called mexico .
it â€™ s supposed to be secret .
same thing with australia .
all of a sudden , people are finding out exactly what took place .
everybody saw this .
how do they do it ?
you know why ?
â€ that â€™ s what they â€™ re supposed to do .
they â€™ re supposed to â€” he didn â€™ t just call russia .
he â€™ s doing the job .
you know , he was doing his job .
and then he didn â€™ t remember .
and that just wasn â€™ t acceptable to me .
yes ?
question : ( inaudible ) clarification here .
and if so , what was the nature of those conversations ( inaudible ) ?
it was â€” it â€™ s a joke .
they â€” i hadn â€™ t spoken to them .
i don â€™ t think i â€™ ve ever met him .
i don â€™ t think i ever met him .
now , it â€™ s possible that i walked into a room and he was sitting there , but i don â€™ t think i ever met him .
i didn â€™ t talk to him ever .
and he thought it was a joke .
look at his phone records , et cetera , et cetera .
and the other person , people knew that he represented various countries , but i don â€™ t think he represented russia , but knew that he represented various countries .
that â€™ s what he does .
i mean , people know that .
he â€™ s a respected man .
but i think he represented the ukraine or ukraine government or somebody , but everybody â€” people knew that .
everybody knew that .
and i can tell you , speaking for myself , i own nothing in russia .
i have no loans in russia .
i don â€™ t have any deals in russia .
he then , called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration , which was terrific .
so that â€™ s the extent .
and it was totally â€” they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women , i have to tell you , totally misrepresented .
question : obama ( ) 426 on ( ) .
question : ( ) why should americans trust you ( ) the information ( ) ?
but it was a very substantial victory , do you agree with that ?
ok thank you , that â€™ s .
what â€” what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing ?
question : can we ask what you â€™ re going to do and also , we â€™ ve heard about a â€” a review of the intelligence community headed up by steven feinberg , what can you tell us about that ?
the gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man , very successful man and he â€™ s offered his services and you know , it â€™ s something we may take advantage of .
but i don â€™ t think we â€™ re need that at all because of the fact that you know , i think that we are gon na be able to straighten it out very easily on its own .
it was really , what happened after that but he didn â€™ t think anything was done wrong .
the information was provided by â€” who i don â€™ t know , sally yates .
that was very normal .
after they thought about it , it turned out he was just doing his job .
so â€” and i do .
..go ahead .
question : i â€™ m sorry .
what will you do on the leaks ?
i â€™ ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we â€™ re â€” i â€™ ve actually called the justice department to look into the leaks .
those are criminal leaks .
injustice , as an example ( ph ) .
it â€™ s a criminal act .
you know what i say , when i â€” when i was called out on mexico , i was shocked because all this equipment , all this incredible phone equipment â€” when i was called out on mexico , i was â€” honestly , i was really , really surprised .
same thing with australia .
so i â€™ m dealing with mexico , i â€™ m dealing with argentina , we were dealing on this case with mike flynn .
that â€™ s why it â€™ s a criminal penalty .
but i â€™ m not ok when it is fake .
it â€™ s ok , jim ( ph ) .
it â€™ s ok , jim ( ph ) you â€™ ll have your chance .
but i watch others too .
but i think it should be straight .
people â€” i mean , you have a lower approval rate than congress .
i think that â€™ s right .
because you know i think they have lower â€” i heard lower than congress .
trump : i think we â€™ re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet .
yeah , go ahead , jimmy .
i have nothing to do with russia .
i told you , i have no deals there , i have no anything .
nobody mentions that hillary received the questions to the debates .
can you imagine â€” seriously â€” can you imagine if i received the questions ?
yes ?
question : â€” inauguration .
very simple .
mike was doing his job .
he was calling countries and his counterparts .
ok ?
jim ?
question : thank you very much , and just for the record , we don â€™ t hate you .
i don â€™ t hate you .
ok ?
you welcomed that .
at another campaign press conference you called on the russians to find the missing 30 , 000 .
ready ?
question : if i may as a follow up ?
question : yes , sir .
but it wasn â€™ t classified information .
i don â€™ t want to be hacked .
and we did that .
and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed .
the dnc did not do that .
i mean , think of it .
why did hillary clinton announce that , â€œ i â€™ m sorry , but i have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall , and i feel that it â€™ s inappropriate , and i want to turn in cnn for not doing a good job .
â€ question : and if i may follow up on that , just something that jonathan karl ( ph ) was asking you about .
i guess i don â€™ t understand .
here â€™ s the thing .
they don â€™ t know if it â€™ s true or false because they â€™ re not involved .
i â€™ m involved .
i â€™ ve been involved with this stuff all my life .
but i â€™ m involved .
so i know when you â€™ re telling the truth or when you â€™ re not .
i see tone .
you know the word â€œ tone .
â€ the tone is such hatred .
they â€™ re very â€” not because they â€™ re good , because they hit me also when i do something wrong .
but they have the most honest morning show .
it â€™ s the most honest .
but the tone , jim .
you just take a look at that show .
that is a constant hit .
the panel is almost always exclusive .
but the panel is almost exclusive .
i watch it .
i see it .
i â€™ m amazed by it .
they want to throw their placards at cnn .
you know .
but you just take a look .
take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening .
now , they â€™ ll take this news conference â€” i â€™ m actually having a very good time , ok ?
ok ?
i certainly didn â€™ t win by people listening to you people .
that â€™ s for sure .
but i â€™ m having a good time .
â€ i â€™ m not ranting and raving .
i â€™ m just telling you .
you know , you â€™ re dishonest people .
but â€” but i â€™ m not ranting and raving .
i love this .
i â€™ m having a good time doing it .
â€ i â€™ m not ranting and raving .
what do you think , peter ?
peter , should i have â€” let him have a little bit more ?
sit down .
sit down .
we â€™ ll .
question : doesn â€™ t that under .
question : .
..
i know , but aren â€™ t you .
..
question : i am not related , sir .
no .
alex acosta .
question : i â€™ m sure you checked that out , sir .
i do that .
here â€™ s the thing .
ok .
i understand what you â€™ re â€” and you â€™ re right about that , except this .
i know what â€™ s bad .
so i understand it .
so , because i â€™ m there .
i â€™ m there .
now , maybe i had something to do with that .
i don â€™ t know .
of course , he had some questions also .
i won .
i won .
and the other thing , chaos because zero chaos .
we are running â€” this is a machine and reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press ( ph ) .
i mean , he won the election , right ?
we won the presidency .
â€ i mean , they â€™ re fake .
they â€™ re not true .
and isn â€™ t that a shame because he â€™ d rather be working on healthcare , he â€™ d rather be working on tax reform , jim ( ph ) .
i mean that .
but â€” and i understand that .
they see it .
they see it â€™ s not fair .
you take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred .
question : ( inaudible ) .
and second .
that â€™ s a ruse .
â€ it â€™ s not terrible .
we had hillary clinton try and do a reset .
you know what uranium is , right ?
this thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things .
nobody talks about that .
i didn â€™ t do anything for russia .
i â€™ ve done nothing for russia .
hillary clinton did a reset , remember ?
here , take a look .
now if i do that , oh , i â€™ m a bad guy .
maybe it is .
â€ ok ?
question : is tax reform on the line ( ph ) ?
we â€™ re doing obamacare .
we â€™ re in final stages .
so we â€™ ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early march , march .
yes ?
question : you mentioned the vessel â€” the spy vessel off the coast of the united states .
when did it happen ?
â€ because the â€” you have to understand .
wait , wait .
so hillary clinton tries a reset .
it failed .
they all tried .
but i â€™ m different than those people .
and what do you intend to do about them ?
have you given rex tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal ?
i have .
and i â€™ m so beautifully represented .
..
i don â€™ t know .
we might .
we might not .
but you know what ?
there â€™ s no upside .
we â€™ re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they .
i have been briefed .
they â€™ re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we .
question : no , i read off the three things that have recently happened .
do they undermine .
no .
.. ( crosstalk ) question : .
and i understand what they â€™ re doing because they â€™ re doing the same thing .
now , again , maybe i â€™ m not going to be able to do a deal with russia , but at least i will have tried .
ok ?
she had the reset .
she did other things .
question : can we .
nothing .
â€ in the meantime , mosul is very , very difficult .
do you know why ?
so i don â€™ t have to tell you .
â€ i don â€™ t have to do that .
you know why ?
because they shouldn â€™ t know .
ok .
the trouble .
question : bbc .
impartial , free and fair .
sure .
question : on the travel ban â€” we could banter back and forth .
on the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government .
i do .
let me tell you about this government .
..
question : were there any mistakes .
wait .
i know who you are .
just wait .
let me tell you about the travel ban .
we had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban .
but we had a bad court .
we had a court that â€™ s been overturned .
again , may be wrong .
but i think it â€™ s 80 percent of the time , a lot .
we had a bad decision .
but we had a bad decision .
that â€™ s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban .
you had some people that were put out there , brought by very nice busses , and they were put out at various locations .
despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court .
the rollout was perfect .
but gen. kelly , now sec .
you do agree there are bad people out there , right ?
that not everybody that â€™ s like you .
you have some bad people out there .
and he was right .
but that â€™ s why we did it quickly .
now in the meantime , we â€™ re vetting very , very strongly .
very , very strongly .
question : just a brief .
but if it â€™ s so urgent , why not introduce .
question : thank you .
but he was dealing , as he should have been .
question : during the election ?
nobody that i know of .
nobody .
..
..
question : .
.. of the election ?
russia is a ruse .
i have nothing to do with russia .
don â€™ t speak to people from russia .
not that i wouldn â€™ t .
i just have nobody to speak to .
i spoke to putin twice .
he called me on the election .
i told you this .
so i â€™ m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it .
i have nothing to do with russia .
to the best of my knowledge no person that i deal with does .
now , manafort has totally denied it .
he denied it .
i think he represented ukraine or people having to do with ukraine , or people that â€” whoever .
but people knew that .
everybody knew that .
you know that , right ?
he was replaced long before the election .
but paul manafort , who â€™ s a good man also by the way , paul manfort was replaced long before the election took place .
he was only there for a short period of time .
is that ok ?
five ?
let â€™ s see .
watch how friendly he is .
wait .
wait .
watch how friendly he is .
question : ( ) .
i ( inaudible ) .
i haven â€™ t seen anybody in my community , including yourself or any of the â€” anyone on your staff of being ( ) .
because ( ) .
and it â€™ s not , its not , not â€” not a simple question , not a fair question .
ok sit down , i understand the rest of your question .
but let me just tell you something , that i hate the charge , i find it repulsive .
question : thank you , i â€™ m lisa ( ph ) from the .
even its broad outlines ?
question : .
..countries ?
trump : we â€™ re gon na show great heart , daca is a very , very difficult subject for me , i will tell you .
we â€™ re gon na deal with daca with heart .
and i appreciate your understanding on that .
but the daca situation is a very , very â€” it â€™ s a very difficult thing for me because you know , i love these kids , i love kids , i have kids and grandkids .
ok ?
.. ( crosstalk ) question : .
..reopening of the white house visitors office ?
that is very â€” who are you with ?
i â€™ ll just tell you this .
and they â€™ re not doing this for money .
and melania goes back and forth and after barron finishes school â€” because it â€™ s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left â€” she and barron will be moving over to the white house .
ok , thank you , that â€™ s a very nice question .
question : it doesn â€™ t ( ph ) have ( ph ) to be a bad question .
fixing the inner cities .
see , it wasn â€™ t bad , was it ?
but it could be something that i think that will be very good for everybody concerned .
we â€™ re going to try and fix as quickly as possible â€” you know , it takes a long time .
they â€™ re living in hell .
we can â€™ t let that happen .
there â€™ s another chicago that â€™ s worse than almost any of the places in the middle east that we talk , and that you talk about , every night on the newscasts .
ok ?
question : no â€” no â€” no .
question : i â€™ m just a reporter .
question : i know some of them , but i â€™ m sure they â€™ re watching right now .
i actually thought i had a meeting with congressman cummings and he was all excited .
i can â€™ t have that meeting .
you know , we called him and called him .
i spoke to him on the phone , very nice guy .
but he probably was told by schumer or somebody like that , some other lightweight .
it â€™ s bad politics .
question : ( inaudible ) .
what do you .
..and some of it â€” can i be honest with you ?
and this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up .
you do know that .
do you understand that ?
some of the signs you â€™ ll see are not put up by the people that love or like donald trump , they â€™ re put up by the other side and you think it â€™ s like playing it straight ?
no .
but you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side .
they â€™ ll do signs and they â€™ ll do drawings that are inappropriate .
it won â€™ t be my people .
it will be the people on the other side to anger people like you .
where is that ?
we lived in a divided nation .
thank you .

it also included no estimates of the number of people who would gain or lose insurance under the plan , nor did it include comparisons with the affordable care act , which has extended coverage to 20 million people .
with the house proposal â€™ s rollback of medicaid payments to the states , it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller .
â€ sketchy as the outline was , it envisions major changes .
it would fundamentally remake medicaid , a great society program that provides health care to more than 70 million americans , not just the poor , but also people who have run out of money and need nursing home care .
it has become increasingly clear that this law is collapsing .
their deductibles are soaring , and their choices are dwindling .
the congressional budget office says that 12 million people have insurance because they became eligible for medicaid under the affordable care act , and it estimates that federal spending for this group will be $ 70 billion this year .
under that law , the tax credits are available only for insurance products that meet detailed federal standards and are purchased through an insurance exchange like healthcare .

mr. acosta â€™ s record and writings will undergo close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing .
i. o. trade union .
progressive groups , such as the democratic â€œ super pac â€ american bridge , were busy on thursday digging through his background and looking for stains on his record .
a report on the case found that mr. acosta had ignored warning signs about such problems .
she also said mr. acosta had described paying lip service to lawmakers when called to testify before congress .
â€ ''
in calling for a legal the justice department avoided a supreme court test of the original executive order .
the panel heard arguments a few days later , and in a unanimous decision last thursday , it refused to reinstate the ban .
mr. mccain was angered by mr. mulvaney â€™ s support for firm spending limits on the defense department .
mr. mulvaney enters the job with a busy agenda , because the administration must prepare a budget and address raising the debt limit in the coming weeks .
mr. mulvaney was blamed by democrats and some republicans for orchestrating a government shutdown during the obama era .
â€œ there â€™ s tremendous enthusiasm out there .
â€ not long after , in a posting on twitter , mr. trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the saturday evening event , which will take place just up the coast from his retreat in palm beach where he plans to spend the weekend .
it will be his third weekend in a row on florida â€™ s gold coast .
â€ the white house would not provide any additional information about the rally .
officials referred questions to a member of mr. trump â€™ s political organization , who also did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
at the end of 2016 , he had $ 7 , 611 , 702 .
92 cash on hand and no debt .
on tuesday , he accepted the resignation of his national security adviser , michael t. flynn , who had become embroiled in allegations that he had improper contacts with russian officials before mr. trump took office .
â€œ if it was an official white house event , he would have less control over it .

1175,18614 , pakistan shrine bombing kills scores in worst attack in months - the new york times , new york times , salman masood,2017-02-17,2017.0,2.0 , , '' islamabad , pakistan â€” a suicide bomber turned a spiritual dance celebration at a revered religious shrine into a slaughterhouse on thursday , killing at least 70 people and wounding more than 250 in the worst act of terrorism to hit pakistan in months .
the islamic state , which regards members of other muslim groups as nonbelievers deserving death , also claimed responsibility for an attack on a sufi shrine in southwestern pakistan in november .
sufism , popular in pakistan , is regarded as a relatively tolerant branch of islam .
the shrine assault on thursday was by far the worst in a wave of militant attacks that have shaken pakistan this week , most claimed by the taliban .
a spokesman for the armed forces , maj. gen. asif ghafoor , announced on twitter that the border closing was effective immediately .
the bombing thursday evening targeted the shrine of lal shahbaz qalandar , a popular sufi saint , in sehwan , a city in jamshoro district of the southern sindh province .
the remoteness of the region added to the difficulties faced by the survivors and emergency responders .
â€œ but we can â€™ t let these events divide us , or scare us .
we must stand united in this struggle for the pakistani identity and universal humanity .
â€œ pakistan is under attack .
â€œ sehwan is synonymous with pakistan â€™ s sufi culture and tradition , which has been dealt a devastating blow today .

shiites are a majority in iraq and dominate the national government .
the bombing took place in the baya neighborhood of southern baghdad , where there are a number of parking lots in which people gather to buy and sell used cars , attracting large crowds on weekday afternoons .
shiite militias , known as popular mobilization forces , are expected to take part in the military assault in western mosul and particularly in the neighboring city of tal afar to the west .
â€ mosul , the last major city in iraq where the islamic state still maintains significant control , is the capital of nineveh province .
baghdad has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks recently .

there , an auto repair shop on coney island avenue posted a handmade sign on its metal shutter : â€œ we are immigrants .

after reaching a $ 20 million settlement with gretchen carlson , a former anchor who sued mr. ailes , and conducting an internal investigation into his conduct , the company tried hard to put the episode behind it .

a judge rejected that claim on wednesday and ruled that her case would be resolved in arbitration .
mr. ailes has denied the sexual harassment allegations .

the plants also fight disease , it turns out .
but the meadows are vanishing at a rate of a football field every 30 minutes .
with these adaptations , seagrass meadows became more productive than today â€™ s fertilized cornfields .
animals like manatees and juvenile fish took up residence .

the plants also draw fertilizer runoff and other pollutants out of the water , locking them safely away in meadow soil .
she discussed the idea with dr. lamb , who began to investigate .
that oxygen might be able to kill pathogens , dr. lamb realized .
the plants also host fungi , which are known to producing compounds .
levels of the bacteria in water from seagrass meadows , they found , were a third of the levels in water from other sites .
in a second search , the scientists grabbed fragments of dna floating in seawater .
by examining the sequences , they identified 18 kinds of bacteria .
water from the seagrass meadows had only half the level of this dna , compared with water collected at other sites .
thorsten b. reusch , a marine ecologist at the geomar helmholtz center for ocean research in germany who was not involved in the study , called it â€œ truly fascinating and innovative .
â€ he also warned that â€œ it remains to be seen what the exact mechanisms of the pathogen removal are .
â€ dr. lamb and her colleagues are now searching for those mechanisms .
nearly a third of the world â€™ s seagrass meadows have died off since the 19th century .
seagrass is also being pummeled by climate change .
with less oxygen to pump into their roots , they are poisoned by toxic sediments .
dr. orth and his colleagues estimate that the seagrass has eliminated more than 500 million juvenile blue crabs since 1991 .
seagrass meadows can store enormous amounts of carbon .
their soils don â€™ t decompose because they have very little oxygen in them .
as a result , seagrass meadow soil around the world has accumulated an estimated nine billion tons of carbon .
as seagrass meadows disappear , that carbon is being released back into the ocean .
as dire as the situation has become , there is cause for hope .

at an appearance in december at the university of he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk .
other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks .
the matter dates to 2006 , when an officer began raising concerns about misconduct within the national police service .
he has been attacked by critics who charge that he missed opportunities to resolve the mess in 2014 , and supported the police chief at the time and his justice minister for too long .
late wednesday night he survived a motion put forward by sinn fein .
on wednesday evening , ahead of the vote , mr. kenny apologized in parliament to sergeant mccabe .
he called the allegations against him â€œ appalling .
the mccabe case has exposed the secretive and insular nature of the police service .
but a police chief , martin callinan , stunned the country when he told lawmakers in 2014 that like sergeant mccabe were â€œ disgusting .

she has asserted her innocence .
nevertheless , mr. trump has consistently rejected the notion that his rhetoric or policy proposals have been divisive or extreme .
his studio sits beside a wide boulevard without nearby stop signs , red lights or crosswalks , so cars and trucks hurtle past day and night at terrifying speeds .
there , he bought two gallon jugs of filtered water .
an imac , loaded with protools production software , sat atop a giotto monograph and a massive tome called â€œ recording the beatles .
longstreth , 35 , draws from a wide range of references , and in between seven dirty projectors albums he has put his fingerprints all over work by an impressive variety of artists .
â€ a freight train rumbled past the studio on tracks abutting the building .
before long , i detected another , gentler source of noise pollution .
the result â€” a covers record riddled with the flubs and inventions of forgetfulness â€” was a jumble of intricate syncopations , vertiginous time changes and splintery guitar work .
the song put dirty projectors at the forefront of the booming brooklyn scene , alongside simpatico acts like vampire weekend , animal collective and grizzly bear .
the answer was complicated .
after their breakup , longstreth and coffman reached a dÃ©tente solid enough that she asked him to produce her solo record .
we were reinventing how we related to each other .
â€ by the end of 2015 , they â€™ d more or less finished the album .
in an act of symbolic accord , its last song shared musical motifs with the last song on longstreth â€™ s .
on the floor of longstreth â€™ s studio were 15 stacks of index cards .
the topmost cards bore different inscriptions in black sharpie : these were names of new songs in various stages of completion , with each stack containing longstreth â€™ s notes for a different song .
â€ an engineer named robby moncrieff commandeered the imac , dialing up the protools session for a song currently called â€œ suck my lifestyle .
â€ it featured a riot of snares , bongos , tambourines , cabasas , and claps .
some of these instruments were acoustic others , .
as moncrieff recorded him , longstreth sat with an acoustic guitar and diligently replayed the digitized riff live , returning it to the realm of the analog : an oil painting of a photoshop collage .
( according to longstreth , west initially envisioned that track as a solo , then added rihanna . )
west routinely assembles motley creative brain trusts , and the brusque , bronx rapper french montana and the slick canadian singer the weeknd were there , too .
â€ longstreth , a coffee geek who observes a precise ritual , brought along his own ceramic dripper and , as he put it , â€œ third wave roasted beans , â€ which apparently entertained west â€™ s wife , kim kardashian .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ longstreth recalled .
â€œ like , maybe you â€™ re with your girlfriend but thinking of your ex , â€ longstreth explained .
â€ the path that longstreth took to hanging out with kanye west in mexican mansions is improbable .
they levied a prohibition on video games and grew their own food .
we ate eggs from our chickens , who were my responsibility .
â€ their parents , he added , â€œ were rock â€™ n â€™ rollers in the â€™ 60s , but they listened pretty widely : baroque music titans of â€™ 40s , â€™ 50s , â€™ 60s jazz the â€˜ big chill â€™ soundtrack .
â€ longstreth â€™ s early recordings were rough by design : and even ugly .
â€œ but i was too curious about chords and instruments and recording to stay locked in that mentality .
â€ he enrolled at yale , where he studied music , but was unhappy .
â€œ it wasn â€™ t about intellectual curiosity or mastery .
by the time longstreth moved to brooklyn , he was something of a minor legend in circles : ascetic , eccentric and respected for it .
afterward we walked to his cluttered prius , where he retrieved â€œ the fractal geometry of nature , â€ a book by the mathematician benoit mandelbrot featuring fractals .
â€œ this is a late christmas present for my friend zach harris , â€ longstreth explained .
do you want to pop in on him ? â€ longstreth moved to california in 2014 , and through his girlfriend and his brother , he gained entry into a circle of fine artists in town .
harris welcomed longstreth into his studio with a hug .
he wore a mustache and white jeans .
some bullets too .
many were covered and crisscrossed by carved pieces of wood that harris had machined with a laser , then painted colors .
between these lattices he â€™ d inscribed legions of tiny figures engaged in odd , feverish interactions .
longstreth nodded .
â€œ there â€™ s a thing here and an egyptian thing here â€” in painting , you can take all these different visual languages and styles and put them together .
there â€™ s a sense of that in dave â€™ s songs , too .
â€ longstreth appeared to blush at the sound of his friend describing his music with such care .
he lingered a bit more , paging through the mandelbrot book .
it was nearly noon , and he had his own little universe to get lost in . ''

unfortunately , it â€™ s a word i can â€™ t repeat here .
diane utters it about 20 minutes into the pilot it appears copiously thereafter .
it â€™ s not as jarring as you might think .
( the episodes also run slightly longer . )
consistency is no crime , but it will be interesting to see if the show evolves .
the firm setting , for instance , might shake up the often very white legal world of â€œ the good wife .
diane stands in for a certain breed of liberal who expected to be able to take a breather , the glass ceiling shattered , the gains consolidated .

consider the international association of machinists and aerospace workers , which also endorsed mrs. clinton .
in response , progressives have groused that some unions are willing to sell their souls for a few thousand jobs .
all in all , it is precisely the backlash that must delight the current occupants of the west wing .
for that matter , mr. trump â€™ s own coalition is hardly a model of cohesion .
but he faced criticism on the right over his openness to immigration .
combined with relentless opposition from the labor movement , his nomination proved untenable .

blended into that equation is a standoff between the international monetary fund and european countries over how much more austerity to require of greece .

once airborne , the contest was a showdown between zach lavine , the eventual winner , and gordon that brought back memories of michael jordan versus dominique wilkins in the 1980s , minus the outsize reputations .
gordon routed it through his legs on a reverse dunk .
according to the associated press , the telecast drew seven million viewers at its peak , the highest total for any cable show that night .
but even before his season ended this month with a torn anterior cruciate ligament , lavine announced that he would not vie for a third consecutive victory .
that theory will be put to its biggest test on saturday , with the quartet of ?
a. players , or basketball players at all ?

but its audience appeal also seems more dependent on names .
giancarlo stanton beat such notables as robinson cano and todd frazier in 2016 , when the derby drew 5 .

1229,18672 , kraft heinz offers to buy unilever in $ 143 billion deal - the new york times , new york times , michael j. de la merced and chad bray,2017-02-18,2017.0,2.0 , , '' the world â€™ s grocery carts could soon be filled with more and more products from one global colossus .
pressed by growing competition from upstarts and changing consumer habits , food and giants will have little choice but to seek deals .
it also has the support of warren e. buffett , who has previously collaborated with 3g and is expected to provide financing in any deal with unilever .
a combination of kraft heinz and unilever would create an empire of hundreds of household names , with more than $ 82 billion in sales .
kraft heinz approached unilever about a potential deal in the last few weeks , according to people briefed on the matter , who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations .
shares of kraft heinz surged nearly 11 percent .
they moved into fast food by buying burger king , then merging it with tim hortons , canada â€™ s foremost purveyor of coffee and doughnuts .
and with mr. buffett â€™ s help , they bought heinz in 2013 , transforming a staid american ketchup legend into a lean maker of condiments and canned soups .
two years later , in 2015 , they bought kraft to become even bigger .
now â€” almost two years after the kraft deal â€” 3g and kraft heinz are casting their eyes on unilever , which is the seller of packaged food worldwide and the maker behind procter gamble .
it has also moved to update its products with younger , hipper names by buying like dollar shave club and the cleaning products maker seventh generation .
a deal for unilever would be expensive by any measure , particularly because kraft heinz already has nearly $ 30 billion in debt on its books .
raphael moreau , an analyst with euromonitor in london , said that unilever might ultimately be willing to pursue a smaller deal with kraft to offload some of its food brands .

food , water and cooking fuel have all been reported to be in short supply , and residents have described increased harassment from islamic state fighters preparing for the attack .
in late january , they reached the banks of the tigris river , which bisects mosul , and declared the city â€™ s eastern section liberated .
the west is home to neighborhoods of narrow streets , some so small that it will not be possible for iraqi troops to enter in their fortified humvees .
because all five of the bridges spanning the tigris have been bombed , iraqi troops will trace a circuitous path to western mosul , initially approaching it from the south .
while the airport may be unusable , taking it would still be a milestone for the offensive , as would taking the adjacent hilltop village of abu saif , which sits at a higher elevation than mosul .

1248,18693 , buzzing reporters and a mystery witness : scenes from the durst hearing - the new york times , new york times , charles v. bagli,2017-02-20,2017.0,2.0 , , '' the coming trial of robert a. durst in los angeles may not have the star power of the 1995 murder trial of o. j. simpson , the former n. f. l. running back and actor .
mr. durst , although the offspring of a manhattan real estate family , does not have a similar claim to fame .
but he drew widespread attention as the central figure in a 2015 hbo documentary â€” â€œ the jinx : the life and deaths of robert durst â€ â€” that was broadcast internationally .
so it was perhaps fitting that mr. durst â€™ s pretrial hearing last week in los angeles superior court had all the makings of a media frenzy .
mary hearn , the superior court â€™ s director of public information , kept careful track of who filled the 42 seats inside the court .
the new york times was not on â€œ the list .
six members of the defense team took up the seats in the gallery behind mr. durst , possibly to prevent reporters from getting too close to him .
at least some of the reporters covering the hearing had not yet been born when mr. durst â€™ s very twisty story began in 1982 with the vanishing of his wife , kathleen durst , several months before she would have graduated from medical school .
mr. lewin may have a reason for obtaining testimony before the trial other than simply to preserve witness statements .
the first witness last tuesday was albert kuperman , an former dean of the medical school that kathleen durst attended between 1978 and 1982 .
although he knew her only in passing , he described her as a diligent student .
the crux of his testimony had to do with a telephone call to his office on feb. 1 , 1982 , the day after ms. durst disappeared , from a woman who may or may not have been her .
i briefly became the story before testimony resumed on wednesday .
the court had to review a motion by the defense to sequester me from the trial .
mr. chesnoff argued that i had â€œ spent a career investigating mr. durst and circumstances surrounding mr. durst â€™ s entanglements .
â€œ mr .
besides , he added , california â€™ s shield law would prevent the defense from calling a reporter as a witness .

game .
â€œ they have to figure it out themselves .
perhaps there was a brief dÃ©tente for the west â€™ s victory over the east .
â€œ that â€™ s all that happened .

it â€™ s basketball .
westbrook was not pleased .
durant , for example , was asked how he dealt with potential distractions .
â€ as for westbrook , he refused even to dip his toes into the topic .

whenever possible â€” which was often â€” they took up residence at opposite ends of the court .
warriors coach steve kerr , who coached the west said he had no intention of organizing any kind of meeting between the two to work on healing their feud .
that was not his job .
â€œ it â€™ s a hectic weekend for all of them .
i want everybody to be comfortable and happy .
durant , a forward , is averaging 25 .
3 rebounds and 4 .
9 assists for the warriors , who have a record .
he is also shooting a 53 .
9 percent from the field , a product of his own improvement , along with the ability of his teammates to draw defensive attention .
but i think it turned for steph when he realized he didn â€™ t have to do anything differently .
â€ in durant â€™ s absence , westbrook has hauled the thunder to a record .
he is averaging 31 .
1 assists .
he is bidding to become only the second player to average a â€” double figures in three of five major statistical categories â€” for an entire season .
oscar robertson did it in .

without durant , the thunder are determined overachievers .
i â€™ m happy .
i â€™ m having fun .
but durant â€™ s departure appears to have motivated westbrook even more , no small feat .
this is his version of happiness .
it is down below , in serbia and kosovo , where old angers are resurfacing as the balkan region that spawned so much suffering over the last century is again becoming dangerously restive .
a month later , russia backed fringe opposition parties in delicate national elections in macedonia , another former yugoslav republic .
that process had recently produced a small breakthrough , as kosovo was about to get its own +383 calling code .
it was built on the serbian side of the bridge that crosses the ibar , a project that the european union funded in hopes of linking the divided communities .
most inflammatory , the serbian government sent a train from belgrade to mitrovica , adorning its coaches with signs declaring that â€œ kosovo is serbia â€ in more than 20 languages .
kosovo stopped the train at the border , accusing serbia of wanting to stage an invasion of northern kosovo , modeled on russia â€™ s annexation of crimea .
but there are 70 , 000 other serbs scattered in southern kosovo who feel more exposed to retaliation .
â€ â€œ every time they call me from serbia , they ask : â€˜ is there war ?
are they trying to kill you ?
â€œ i tell them , â€˜ no , they are not. â€™ there is no war .
i can â€™ t lie .
in the absence of an army of their own , most ethnic albanians see nato troops as protectors of their state in kosovo .
where were they when people were chased out of their homes in broad daylight ? â€ at the same time , ms. milic blamed serbian politicians in belgrade for the misfortune of kosovo â€™ s serbs .

but they often ran roughshod over those who tried to check their power , from judges to international lenders .
and now , nearly all are gone .
in argentina in 2015 , voters elected a businessman to replace a populist , cristina fernÃ¡ndez de kirchner , whose programs were popular with the poor and working class .
then , november brought the death of the of the region â€™ s left : fidel castro of cuba .
by most accounts , poverty and inequality decreased in ecuador as mr. correa funneled oil revenue into everything from raising the salaries of teachers to rebuilding the country â€™ s highways and expanding clinics into the amazon region .
mr. correa also pulled his tiny country onto the international stage , echoing mr. castro from an earlier time by railing against capitalism and globalization .
in 2012 , he granted julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , protection at the ecuadorean embassy in london , a thumb in the eye of the united states .
as in argentina , venezuela and brazil , the social programs in ecuador that lifted millions out of poverty were underwritten by a commodities boom that sputtered out years ago .
government revenue , around $ 25 billion a year when oil prices spiked , has now shrunk to less than half that , $ 11 billion , mainly because of the declining price of oil .
that has left the country heavily indebted to china .
that is the stance championed by the conservative opposition candidate guillermo lasso , a wealthy banker from mr. correa â€™ s hometown , guayaquil , who finished second in the last election against him in 2013 .
mr. lasso is promising to roll back public spending while eliminating more than a dozen taxes , which would mean the loss of billions of dollars from state coffers .
mr. leÃ³n pointed to an authoritarian streak in mr. correa that also became a hallmark of leftists in several other south american countries .

the proposed designation has also reaffirmed mr. trump â€™ s apparent embrace of mr. sisi , who has weathered a barrage of international criticism for his country â€™ s dismal human rights record in recent years .

floods ravaged the cemetery , leaving behind a stockpile of concrete crosses .
the hospital designed by the acclaimed detroit architect albert kahn ?
plunderers destroyed it .
but there they were , thanks to the squatters .
i explored the outpost on foot , wandering the ruins and talking to gold prospectors , farmers and descendants of plantation workers who live here .
hardly a lost city , fordlÃ¢ndia is home to about 2 , 000 people , some who live in the crumbling structures built nearly a century ago .
brazil was home to hevea brasiliensis , the coveted rubber tree , and the amazon basin had boomed from 1879 to 1912 as industries in north america and europe fed the demand for rubber .
but to the dismay of brazil â€™ s leaders , henry wickham , a british botanist and explorer , had spirited thousands of hevea seeds out of santarÃ©m , providing the genetic stock for rubber plantations in british , dutch and french colonies in asia .
but ford despised relying on the europeans , fearing a proposal by winston churchill to create a rubber cartel .
so , in a move that pleased brazilian officials , ford acquired a giant stretch of land in the amazon .
disdainful of experts who could have advised them on tropical agriculture , ford â€™ s men planted seeds of questionable value and let leaf blight ravage the plantation .
streetlamps illuminated concrete sidewalks .
portions of these footpaths persist in the town , near red fire hydrants , in the shadow of decaying dance halls and crumbling warehouses .
â€œ it turns out detroit isn â€™ t the only place where ford produced ruins , â€ said guilherme lisboa , 67 , the owner of a small inn called the pousada americana .
beyond producing rubber , ford , an avowed teetotaler , and skeptic of the jazz age , clearly wanted life in the jungle to be more transformative .
â€œ with a surety of purpose and incuriosity about the world that seems all too familiar , ford deliberately rejected expert advice and set out to turn the amazon into the midwest of his imagination , â€ mr. grandin , the historian , wrote in his account of the town .
now he lives on palm avenue in an old american house he bought for 20 , 000 reais ( about $ 6 , 670 ) from a squatter who fixed it up .
fordlÃ¢ndia inspired a 2008 album by the icelandic composer johann johannsson and a 1997 novel by eduardo sguiglia about an argentine adventurer who travels here to recruit plantation laborers .
some descendants of workers who settled in fordlÃ¢ndia , along with new migrants from other parts in brazil , have small plots where zebu cattle graze .
many survive on small social welfare payments or pensions .
mr. dos santos now lives in a small house near the hospital â€™ s ruins .
scavenging material left by the americans , he fashioned a fishing lantern from old car parts and a spice grinder from discarded machinery .
workers are like dogs : they obey .
â€ but to ford â€™ s dismay , sometimes they didn â€™ t obey .
and in 1930 , workers fed up with eating ford â€™ s diet of oatmeal , canned peaches and brown rice in a sweltering dining hall staged a riot .
some couldn â€™ t adapt to the conditions here , suffering nervous breakdowns .
ford might have avoided such tragedies , and the ruinous management of the plantation , if he had sought counsel from specialists in caring for rubber trees or scholars of the amazon â€™ s capacity to thwart grandiose ventures .
â€œ history is bunk , â€ ford told the new york times in 1921 .
diet is .
well , here we go again because some of those folks also believe that fitness devices â€” fitbit , vivosmart , apple watch â€” must be helpful in losing weight .
for some time , people have been trying to prove devices like these succeed in promoting weight loss .
the sample was also mostly female , and more than of them had college degrees , so the results may not be entirely generalizable .
in 2015 , another study , the trial , was also inconclusive .
the other received â€œ usual care .
the trial took place at the university of pittsburgh between 2010 and 2012 , and it involved more than 470 adults between the ages of 18 and 35 .
all participants were followed for 18 more months .

they also weren â€™ t more fit .
exercise is worthwhile for its own sake .
i have owned a fitbit , a nike fuelband and an apple watch .

but i realized over time that i didn â€™ t really need it .
it â€™ s possible that they provided a benefit .
for that , we â€™ d need a trial .

â€™ â€ russia â€™ s relations with the united states soured during mr. churkin â€™ s tenure at the united nations , first over libya and then over crises in syria and ukraine .
he was a staunch defender of the syrian government of bashar .
but he could also surprise his fellow diplomats .
last december , he negotiated with his french and american colleagues for three hours in a closed room on the wording of a draft resolution to send united nations monitors to oversee evacuations from aleppo .
it was the first time in months that the security council had reached a consensus on syria .

kupchak , along with coach phil jackson , was largely responsible for assembling the lakers teams that won championships in 2009 and 2010 .
the lakers were also limited in their ability to rebuild after signing bryant to a huge contract extension in 2013 .
last season , in what amounted to a glorified farewell tour before bryant â€™ s retirement , the lakers finished with a 17 wins .
â€œ they are becoming increasingly cruel .
the tragedy was a stark reminder about what may lie ahead during the main migration season in libya , the principal springboard for most african migrants seeking to get to europe .
although the illegal trade usually slows for the winter , at least 228 people died in january while trying to reach italy , mostly in smaller boats and inflatable vessels , according to the european border and coast guard agency .
the bodies that washed up near zawiya , a smuggling hub 30 miles west of tripoli , the capital , appeared to be a further sign that greater numbers were starting to set off .
â€œ usually they wait until april or may , and it continues until october , â€ mr. almosrti said .
the toll for 2015 was about 3 , 000 .
the migrants , most of whom are fleeing war or poverty in africa , often arrive in libya after arduous journeys through the desert .
they entrust their lives to smuggling gangs that have set up along a stretch of coast in western libya , which is largely controlled by an array of rival militant groups .
italy recently trained 89 members of the libyan coast guard , hoping they will take distressed boats back to libya instead of allowing them to continue to italy .
the unity government has limited control in tripoli and in a few towns along the coast .
news of the italian training program , however , may be accelerating the migrant crossings .

you can probably whittle your liability by going through last year â€™ s records and checking to see if tips from tax professionals may apply to you .
but it is up to the taxpayer to claim itemized deductions and available tax credits .
if you neglect to do so , you may end up overpaying .
taking deductions requires good .
â€œ for a deduction over $ 5 , 000 , you need an appraisal from a qualified appraiser .

because their income is above the upper limit , they do not do so .
of course , you won â€™ t be held liable for the actions of a thief .
it will be taxable then , but their income may be lower , too .
for tax purposes , alimony counts as earned income , he added , so recipients who otherwise qualify for an i. r. a. may contribute the alimony to it and claim a deduction .
all are especially valuable because they reduce adjusted gross income on line 37 .
that number ripples all through a tax return , often limiting other tax breaks .
if that happens , you will need to recalculate the estimate later â€” in june , september or even the end of the year , depending on when a law is enacted â€” and can reduce the payments accordingly .
whatever the reason , you realize belatedly that you failed to take a deduction for which you were qualified .
it may also be a boon to anyone who bought a item like a car with a big sales tax , and is often the best choice for people over age 65 because many states â€” even new york â€” exempt social security income and some income from state income taxes .

â€ here is how mr. britell chopped and screwed instrumental music and wove it into a film whose three chapters take its hero , chiron , from boyhood ( when the character is nicknamed little ) to manhood ( when he â€™ s known as black ) .
â€ mr. jenkins knew that he wanted an orchestral score .
so mr. britell wrote a simple , somber , plangent piece that he initially called â€œ piano and violin poem , â€ which he recorded in d major .
it became â€œ little â€™ s theme .
â€ for the teenage chiron , mr. britell bent the pitch of â€œ little â€™ s theme â€ until it was in b major .
then , for a harrowing scene involving a schoolyard fight , he slowed the music drastically , until it was almost unrecognizable â€” more than two octaves lower than the original recording .
â€œ in that scene you â€™ re hearing this rumbling .
you almost don â€™ t know what it is .
and then you hear something that almost sounds like a bell , and almost sounds like a bass â€” and in fact it â€™ s the piano and the violins from the very beginning .
â€ for the theme music for chiron â€™ s adulthood , mr. britell reorchestrated â€œ little â€™ s theme â€ for an ensemble of cellos and had them record it in d major â€” but then bent the pitch until it was in a major .
it sounds like a weird cross between basses and cellos .
â€ many members of the audience may not notice that some of the more fantastic effects in the score are its main themes contorted beyond recognition .
but mimicking the effects of chopped and screwed with live orchestra took some serious reverse engineering .

the menorah has connections to rome , she added , â€œ so such an important exhibit could only start here .
according to some scholars , the menorah remained in rome until the vandals looted the city in 455 .
after that , its whereabouts become even murkier .
some claim that it sank to the bottom of the mediterranean in a shipwreck others state that such a shipwreck took place on the tiber river .
novels have also taken up the theme , positing that the menorah was returned to israel , or that perhaps it never left at all and was buried secretly on the road to jerusalem .

1300,18749 , police fear trump immigration orders may handcuff effort to fight gangs - the new york times , new york times , liz robbins,2017-02-23,2017.0,2.0 , , '' brentwood , n. y .
â€œ whether it â€™ s fear of criminals or fear of law enforcement .
it â€™ s that simple .
sanctuary cities , which limit their agencies and local law enforcement officials from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration laws , are facing a similar question .
but to ms. rodriguez , it is not enough .
in 1986 , at the height of the civil war in el salvador , the suffolk county legislature declared the county a place of sanctuary for refugees fleeing conflict in central america .
by 1993 , that resolution was reversed .
according to census statistics through 2014 , 58 , 426 salvadorans live in suffolk county , and nearly live in brentwood .
the police department is still under justice department supervision after the settlement of a 2009 discrimination investigation .
then in 2014 , a suffolk county police sergeant , scott greene , was arrested on charges of stealing from latino drivers during traffic stops .
mr. sini , 36 , a former federal prosecutor , became the police commissioner in december 2015 , after police chief james burke was indicted on charges of covering up the assault of a heroin addict .
ms. rodriguez has retained a lawyer to sue the school district .
â€ ''
and then , just as abruptly , the flow stopped .
today few even try to sneak through .
their hopes , however , are likely to be dashed .
two memos signed by mr. kelly â€” guidelines for mr. trump â€™ s promised immigration crackdown â€” call for aggressively seeking out , detaining and deporting immigrants living without authorization in the united states .
and that means mexico .
officials at the department of homeland security argued that returning central americans to mexico would be done only in a limited fashion , and only after discussions with the government of mexico .
what might mexico do in return ?
refuse to take people who can â€™ t prove mexican citizenship ?
here â€™ s what is at stake .
trying to stop it simply pushes it underground .
mexico is now mainly a passageway .
washington has given mexico $ 24 million to support immigration enforcement â€” mostly in training and gadgetry â€” and obligated $ 75 million more .
of course , mexico doesn â€™ t do this only out of love for its northern neighbor .
â€œ the mexican government persisted because it perceived that a migration crisis on the border with the united states could also damage mexico , â€ he noted .
â€œ there were other things at stake in the relationship that it didn â€™ t want to risk .
most requests are denied , but by then , the immigrant has been living in the united states all that time and may not be easy to find .
the document also raises another alternative : sending migrants back to mexico to wait out the immigration process , even those who are not originally from mexico .
though united states law appears to allow it , mexico â€™ s laws do not , if the immigrant is not a mexican citizen .
the agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails .

it voted republican in every presidential election from 1936 until 2016 , when it voted for hillary clinton by a margin .
the democrats need 24 seats to retake the house .
in between , ed royce and mimi walters represent the and vulnerable districts .
of course , the exact house battleground will be shaped by a lot more than these few factors .
but orange county is not an outlier .
of course , hispanic turnout is notoriously weak in midterm elections .
the party â€™ s increasingly dominant progressive wing could be a liability in these moderate districts .
to some extent , this is a false choice .
the competitive districts are mainly suburban , and there are startlingly few competitive districts in the old rust belt that are traditionally democratic but that are held by republicans .
the races for senate seats and governor â€™ s mansions will often play out in the same white battleground states that decided the 2016 election .
â€ improving job training isn â€™ t a concept .
but those innovations have not much influenced how the labor department spends billions each year on training for unemployed workers .
and because such workers often have less money to pay for online memberships , those kinds of networks are less likely to emerge on their own .
â€œ that â€™ s not a partisan issue .
â€ this white house could also expand the concept of employment to benefit the millions of americans who are freelancers , independent contractors or otherwise part of the â€œ gig economy .
â€œ but what if there was a category of employment that was somewhere between a employee and an independent contractor ? â€ mr. cass asked .

instead , i spent as much time as i normally do online ( all my waking hours ) but shifted most of my energy to looking for zones .
coverage of mr. trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever .
during my week of attempted trump abstinence , i noticed something deeper : he has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind , political or not .
he is no longer just the message .
i spent more time on international news sites like the bbc , and searched for sites covering topics like science and finance .
there he is off in the wings of â€œ the bachelor â€ and even â€œ the big bang theory , â€ whose creator , chuck lorre , has taken to inserting messages in the closing credits .
how about sports ?
yeah , no .

he was the subtext of the super bowl : both the game and the commercials , and maybe even the halftime show .

for much of the past four years , mr. obama â€™ s monthly earned media value hovered around $ 200 million to $ 500 million .
the highest that hillary clinton got during the presidential campaign was $ 430 million , in july .
the list includes mrs. clinton , who in january got $ 200 million in coverage , tom brady ( $ 38 million ) kim kardashian ( $ 36 million ) and vladimir v. putin ( $ 30 million ) all the way down to the 1 , 000th celebrity in mediaquant â€™ s database , the actress madeleine stowe ( $ 1 , 001 ) .
the coverage those 1 , 000 people garnered last month totaled $ 721 million .
and he is on track to match or beat his january record in february , according to mr. senatori â€™ s preliminary figures .
there are now more people on the planet who are more connected than ever before .
facebook estimates that about 3 .
2 billion people have internet connections .
on average , the people of earth spend about eight hours a day consuming media , according to the marketing research firm zenith .
scientists may have discovered a new continent submerged under the ocean near australia .
unlike media , today â€™ s media works according to social feedback loops .
every story that shows any signs of life on facebook or twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet , becoming unavoidable .
in 2006 , duncan watts , a researcher at microsoft who studies social networks , and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of â€œ inequality â€ in how we choose media .
half of the people who arrived at mr. watts â€™ s site were shown just the titles and band name of each song .
the other half were also shown a social signal â€” how many times each song had been downloaded by other users .
inequality went up : when people could see what others were downloading , popular songs became far more popular , and unpopular songs far less popular .
social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes when people could see how others had picked songs , the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success , and bad songs were more likely to become popular .
he is the harambe of politics , the undisputed king of all media .
for now , this might be all right .
today â€™ s newspapers are also full of articles , but many of us aren â€™ t reading newspapers anymore .
1307,18758 , '' men , is exercise putting a damper on your sex life ?
less is known about the effects of exercise , especially heavy exercise , on men â€™ s libidos and fertility .
other small studies , on the other hand , have suggested that lengthy and grueling training may blunt the levels of testosterone in a man â€™ s bloodstream both immediately and over the long term .
the scientists also created a separate questionnaire with detailed queries about exercise habits , including how often and intensely the men worked out each week .
almost 1 , 100 physically active adult men completed all of the questions .
but the scientists wanted to examine each of those aspects of a workout separately , so did not track such overlaps .
they also categorized the men according to their answers about their sex lives , creating groups with relatively high , moderate or low libidos .
and there were clear patterns .
of course , this was a small sample of men who voluntarily chose to complete a personally intrusive survey .
it is impossible to know whether they were truthful or representative of the rest of their gender .
and it did not examine why strenuous exercise might dampen libidos .
â€œ but there does seem be a potential tipping point , â€ after which more exercise may blunt desire .

a director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting .
to contain the fallout , mr. kalanick also began more disclosure .
that tone has been echoed in uber â€™ s workplace .
uber also faces at least three lawsuits in at least two countries from former employees alleging sexual harassment or verbal abuse at the hands of managers , according to legal documents reviewed by the times .
as uber hired more employees , its internal politics became more convoluted .
some are waiting until their equity compensation from uber , which is restricted stock units , is vested .

the foreign ministry has become a propaganda wing serving the kremlin rather than a diplomatic service that establishes foreign policy , said alexei a. venediktov , the longtime editor of the respected echo of moscow radio station .
news published from unidentified sources that constituted opinion or unverified fact also qualified , according to ms. zakharova .
when the extent of the tragedy emerged , russia went into overdrive pumping out alternative versions , most of them fanciful and most blaming ukraine .
it quoted dmitri s. peskov , russia â€™ s presidential spokesman , as denying any link .
the new york times article , by a veteran national security reporter and former moscow correspondent , michael r. gordon , detailed concerns in the american administration about russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty .

they weren â€™ t known smugglers , but rather agents from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives .
the secret account is at the heart of a federal racketeering lawsuit brought by a collective of tobacco farmers who say they were swindled out of $ 24 million .
a pair of a. t. f. informants received at least $ 1 million each from that sum , records show .
the scheme relied on phony shipments of snack food disguised as tobacco .
the agents were experts : their job was to catch cigarette smugglers , so they knew exactly how it was done .
the inspector general â€œ expressed serious concerns , â€ court records show .
nearly all references to the a. t. f. have been blacked out of public court records , and most documents are entirely sealed .
members of congress , particularly republicans , have heaped criticism on the agency for decades , and the national rifle association has lobbied to limit the agency â€™ s authority and funding .
the a. t. f. and the justice department declined to comment .
the tobacco cooperative is suing a former employee and a consultant who , according to court documents , both worked as a. t. f. informants .
the informants have denied all wrongdoing .
part of their defense , records show , is that they acted on behalf of the government .
in response , a judge recently added the united states government as a defendant .
â€ the company began negotiating to buy a tobacco distributor in bristol , va. big south wholesale .
big south â€™ s owners , jason carpenter and christopher small , had a network of customers and owned a warehouse .
they also had an existing secret relationship with the a. t. f. records show .
â€ the basics of cigarette smuggling are simple .
buying cigarettes in states , like virginia , and secretly selling them in states , like new york , generates large profits .
often that means working with informants to buy and sell tobacco on the black market , much the way agents pose as drug dealers to investigate cartels .
because so much of the case remains sealed , mr. carpenter and mr. small are prohibited from answering questions about nearly every aspect of the case .
but there were signs that big south was not a simple tobacco distributor .
its assets included more than two dozen vehicles , including expensive s. u. v.s and a fleet of mercedes , bmw , audi , lexus and jaguar sports cars .
early 2011 was a time of intense pressure inside the a. t. f. the agency was under fire from congress over the fast and furious operation , in which agents allowed gun traffickers to buy weapons and ship them to mexico , hoping the shipments could lead them to major weapons dealers .
5 million , a deal that gave big south the authority to buy and sell cigarettes on behalf of the cooperative .
mr. carpenter and mr. small would then buy the tobacco at a slight markup through a private bank account .
lastly , they would sell the tobacco to big south , again at a markup .
because they had the authority to buy on behalf of the tobacco cooperative , â€œ carpenter and small simply sold products to themselves , â€ the farmers wrote in court documents .
all of these transactions occurred on paper .
their accounts fit with descriptions in court records .
in one deal described in the lawsuit , the informants bought tobacco at $ 15 a carton and sold it to u. s. tobacco at $ 17 .
50 .
mr. moore , the warehouse manager , said agents often told him what to buy on the company â€™ s credit card .
for instance , he recalled spending tens of thousands of dollars at best buy on ipads , televisions and other gifts to curry favor with potential criminal targets .
mr. carpenter and mr. small have also acknowledged in court documents receiving more than $ 1 million each , though it is not clear from public documents whether that was profit or reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of the government .
how that arrangement began is unclear .
the farmers tell a different story , saying they never would have purchased big south if they understood that mr. carpenter and mr. small had a side arrangement that involved selling them tobacco at inflated values .
in march 2013 , mr. moore picked up the phone , called mr. thompson and explained what was happening .
â€œ what was happening there was wrong .
records show that the justice department , which includes the a. t. f. investigated some aspects of the case but no charges were filed .
â€œ we thought they would take it and run with it .
what happened was , they â€™ ve fought us tooth and nail .
â€ because of the sealing order , mr. thompson , mr. batten and others are prohibited from discussing what happened to the money â€” even with their own farmers .
the cooperative recently told a judge that it was under investigation by the treasury department .
and the government wants its money . ''
the candidate , abdullah gul , ultimately reached the presidency without obstruction .
the army â€™ s cultural shift was also reflected in last july â€™ s failed coup attempt .
the government claims that the putsch was organized by an islamist faction within the military , an institution previously assumed to be staffed mainly by kemalists â€” followers of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of the secular turkish state .
the decision to allow female soldiers to wear head scarves threatens to deepen concerns that mr. erdogan seeks to sever the country from its secular moorings .
after the july coup attempt , mr. erdogan also caused alarm in secular circles when he appointed as his military adviser a former general who was fired from the army a few months before the 1997 military intervention because of concerns about his religiosity .
â€œ we don â€™ t want to involve politicians in our air force , army , navy , â€ mr. karakus said in a telephone call .
â€œ if somebody wants to wear beach clothes in the office in the united states , do you accept it ? â€ but many welcomed the decision .
professor merve kavakci is herself a former lawmaker who was screamed at , and later expelled from parliament , when she arrived at the building wearing a head scarf in 1999 .
â€œ it â€™ s not that turkey is not secular any more .
â€œ in the past , turkey has , with its ideology , embraced a very intolerant secularism where religion was subjugated and controlled by the state authority .
this is a clear victory for women empowerment .
â€ others were more circumspect .
â€œ i would characterize this , â€ ms. white added , â€œ as the ultimate humiliation of the kemalist military .

the plot , which turns on a question of real estate , takes its time arriving and mostly hangs around to facilitate debate .
that michael would publish his controversial book just as he â€™ s up for tenure strains credibility , and a later subplot about credit card fraud is even more unlikely .

the fans responded , with attendance rising to 2 .

50 each way ( i bought my ticket online ) is reasonable considering there is no official entrance fee to the park .
tickets can be bought to all five islands in the park , depending on the season .
buying ahead is recommended , and make sure to call the morning of to verify your boat is sailing sometimes there are cancellations because of the weather .
you will need to bring supplies , as there is nothing available to buy on the island .
( there is also no publicly usable electricity or transportation , and the cellphone service is spotty to nonexistent . )
as i was only planning to be there for the day ( camping overnight is also an option ) i just needed food and water for a trip .
i would then follow the old scouting mantra of â€œ pack it in , pack it out â€ â€” taking all my waste with me back to the mainland .
after exiting the freeway in ventura , i headed to the royal bakery and cafe and bought a couple of items : a scone ( $ 2 ) and a much better croissant with turkey and cheese ( $ 3 .

whales are also a common sight during voyages out to the islands â€” there are specific tours â€” but unfortunately none appeared during our trip .

a few passengers set out on the 3. hike to the campground and a couple others went off to hike on their own .
the moderately difficult hike , which consists of some steep , rocky sections , is doable even for beginners .

â€ the project , â€œ treasures from the wreck of the unbelievable , â€ according to those who have glimpsed it , resembles jeweled buried treasure covered with coral as if just pulled out of the ocean , like relics from the lost city of atlantis or captain nemo .
it includes some 250 pieces in various sizes ranging in price from about $ 400 , 000 for small jade objects to $ 4 million for a malachite head of medusa .
the pinault collection â€™ s owner , franÃ§ois pinault , also refused to be interviewed his museum has posted just a couple of tantalizing photographs of mr. hirst â€™ s coming show on its website .
the venice show is the third prong of mr. hirst â€™ s apparent stab at a second act .
the first was his opening of the newport street gallery in south london in october 2015 , which presents exhibitions of work from his collection .
then in april mr. hirst , 51 , announced that he was returning to the gagosian gallery , having left it in 2012 .
already his market is showing signs of strengthening .

â€œ remember the old saying , â€˜ fool me once shame on you , fool me twice shame on me .

whatever the case , most agree that mr. hirst â€” with an estimated net worth of $ 350 million â€” doesn â€™ t need the money .
â€œ the true damien hirst collectors , if they love what he â€™ s doing now , they â€™ ll buy into it and disregard that this guy so many times in the past has way overproduced .

it â€™ s just the sound of the author sharpening her knives , the better to carve up the carcass of what she calls â€œ testosterone rex â€ : the big , scaly body of assumptions , preconceptions , conjectures and distortions regarding â€œ what men are like â€ and â€œ what women are like .
fine , an associate professor at the university of melbourne , is also willing to take a blade to the work of some of her fellow academics .
often , it turns out , it â€™ s not true to the extent we imagine , or not true at all .
take , for instance , that presumption â€” apparently supported by science â€” that men are more enthusiastic than women .
the author continues : â€œ although women routinely take risks , these often seem to slip under the research radar .
in the united states , being pregnant is about 20 times more likely to result in death than is a sky dive .
â€ our habit of defining risk in traditionally male terms has rigged the game against the perception of women as in their own right .
think about it : for every man on the prowl , there simply aren â€™ t a hundred women available to bear his child .
â€ ( or as she quotes yet another academic : â€œ psychologically , men and women are almost a different species .
â€œ not even for those slutty sandpipers .
â€ ) fine is also quite funny when observing how gender roles play out in her own life , and how stereotypes attach to her vocation as a feminist science writer .
if her book has a fault , it is that it is rather too thoroughly argued .
the indomitable fine amasses evidence , addresses objections and accumulates footnotes at such a brisk pace that the panting reader wishes at times for a water break .
there â€™ s no doubt , however , that such tireless energy is just what â€™ s needed to slay a monster of this gargantuan size and this determined tenacity .

mr. firman declined to be interviewed .
when federal officials began issuing detainers in 2008 under a pilot program called secure communities , most jurisdictions treated the requests as mandatory .
more confusion occurred when cities and states adopted their own policies spelling out when to turn over undocumented immigrants .
recent clashes between local and federal officials have only muddied the waters .
and in a radio interview last month , the mayor suggested that turning local police into a deportation force would make the city more dangerous because fewer people would report crimes or cooperate with investigations .
mr. velasquez â€” known to city officials as steven marquez â€” was involved in a clash last year between youths outside queens county criminal courthouse witnesses told investigators they heard gunshots .
but he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor , weapons possession .
that kind of warfare is almost certain to escalate .

today , ford is a man who wears track suits and reading glasses secured by a bejeweled chain , a jarringly endearing detail for someone who teaches others how to inflict pain efficiently .
when davis , 22 , entered the gym a few hours later to find a heavily taped cardboard box on the reception desk , it was ford who handed him the scissors .
ford , wearing a beanie with # strapseason printed on the front , put the belt on the davis .
the new champion posed for a picture under banners that included angelo ward , who trained here before he was shot to death in 2012 , and a scowling version of davis â€™ s younger self , draped in belts and medals a decade ago .
last year , 318 people were killed in baltimore , the homicide total for the city on record 2015 was worse .

ray davis , a fighter ellis trained as a teenager , is in jail after ending up on his own when his father was shot at a corner store .
ronald gibbs , a nationally ranked amateur , was stabbed in the heart in 2012 in a dispute defending his sister .

uber acquired otto in august for $ 680 million , about seven months after mr. levandowski left google .
â€œ ultimately , this calculated theft reportedly netted otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed uber to revive a stalled program , all at waymo â€™ s expense .
â€ uber did not respond to requests for comment .
otto was the brainchild of a handful of former google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant .
later , when google began working on cars , it acquired mr. levandowski â€™ s 510 systems .
mr. levandowski left google in early 2016 to found otto with lior ron , who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping .
waymo noted in its suit that the sale to uber closed shortly after mr. levandowski received his final â€œ multimillion dollar â€ compensation payment from google .
last year , general motors paid more than $ 1 billion for cruise automation , an autonomous vehicle technology and ford recently announced plans to invest $ 1 billion over five years in argo ai , an artificial intelligence formed in december .

uber has also struck a deal with volvo to jointly develop a vehicle , the early versions of it have been released in some cities .
uber , now privately valued at nearly $ 70 billion , has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around silicon valley .

fellow mill owners , largely concentrated in the american southeast , were blaming free trade for destroying their livelihoods .
so mr. ross inquired about opening a mill with hundreds of workers â€” not in the united states , but in vietnam .
â€ just over a year later , in 2006 , mr. ross announced plans to open an $ 80 million cotton plant in vietnam that would employ 1 , 500 workers .
his entry into mexico began in 2007 , a year after he began buying up the global assets of struggling american auto parts makers .

1373,18828 , '' national debt dips .
but the debt is on a clear upward trend .
the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated in january that the debt would increase by $ 559 billion in the current fiscal year , ending in september .
the exact amount of the debt bounces around that trend line because the treasury borrows money by selling securities with maturities â€” or repayment dates â€” ranging from 28 days to 30 years .
that creates an irregular pattern of inflows and outflows from the federal cash box .

â€” on a frigid morning here , nancy godinez was piling bread and other staples into her car outside a food pantry .
she had lost her job as a custodian , her unemployment checks had run out , and her job search had proved fruitless .
one thing she still had was health insurance , acquired three years ago after arkansas â€™ legislature agreed to expand medicaid under the affordable care act .
gov .
they believe that extending medicaid to millions of adults without disabilities under the health law gave them an incentive not to work .
now , even as divisions among republicans in congress slow efforts to repeal the affordable care act , mr. hutchinson and other republican governors are developing proposals to require many medicaid recipients to have a job , participate in job training or perform community service .
but it was an arkansas democrat , bill clinton , whose embrace of work requirements for welfare recipients when he was governor became the basis for the 1996 federal welfare law enacted during his presidency .
in fact , 59 percent of nondisabled adults on medicaid do have jobs , according to the kaiser family foundation .
some have criminal records .
gov .
as a rough model , mr. hutchinson pointed to a work requirement for certain food stamp recipients â€” a federal policy that was part of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul â€” that arkansas reinstated last year .
under that rule , adults without dependents can not receive food stamps for longer than three months unless they are working , volunteering or getting job training for 20 hours a week .
it generally applies to adults ages 18 to 49 unless they are pregnant , have dependent children or are medically certified as â€œ unfit for employment .
â€ since arkansas reimposed the work requirement last year , its food stamp rolls have lost about 36 , 000 people , according to the state department of human services .
mr. caveney has medicaid coverage but lost his food stamps last fall because he was not working the required 20 hours a week .
someone may be legitimately disabled but not yet approved for disability benefits , for example .
that is the case with jimmy t. brunson , 44 , whose diabetes has caused painful neuropathy in his feet .
â€œ i worry that this is all for show .

â€ mr. walden , the new chairman of the house energy and commerce committee , is not just another backbench republican dealing with suddenly energized supporters of the health law at town meetings .
nearly of the state â€™ s four million residents are now on medicaid .
in some of his rural counties , more than of the people are on medicaid .
mr. walden was a trustee of a hospital in his hometown , hood river .
mr. walden grew up on a cherry orchard , worked at radio stations owned by his family , and followed his father into the state legislature .
mr. walden â€™ s margin of victory in november in the county where he lives was just five votes â€” out of more than 10 , 590 cast .
â€œ i â€™ m not an ideologue .
i want to fix things .
â€ and in oregon , some democrats and supporters are glad mr. walden is in his position .
â€ unlike mr. walden , oregon has embraced the affordable care act .
in the early 1990s , it ranked medical procedures according to their costs and benefits , and medicaid uses this list to decide which services to cover .
under a federal waiver granted in 2012 , oregon treats medicaid beneficiaries through 16 â€œ coordinated care organizations , â€ which are governed by local citizen councils .
â€ when mr. walden first ran for congress in 1998 , conservatives called him too liberal .
my bedrock principles have stayed the same .
i favor more local and less washington .
on the day the house passed the bill in march 2010 , he and other republicans stood on the capitol balcony , before a throng of protesters , and held up signs with handwritten letters that spelled out their message : â€œ kill the bill .
â€ a month later , on the house floor , mr. walden announced the goal that he hopes soon to achieve , using words that became the mantra for republicans : â€œ we need to repeal and replace this law .

here , she predicts the oscar winners .
from its premiere at the venice film festival last summer , â€œ la la land , â€ the tale of strivers reaching for glory , has charmed best picture wins out of prize givers .
the failure of â€œ la la land â€ to land even a sag nomination is injurious but hardly fatal .
( the musical is a not an ensemble . )
by now , it is hard to imagine anything stopping the momentum of â€œ la la land .
â€ another point to remember is that when it comes to the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , â€œ best picture â€ really means â€œ most popular picture .
â€ and â€œ la la land â€ is about something that academy voters cherish above all : themselves .
casey affleck has been in the oscar race before but didn â€™ t win .
so i â€™ m betting on mr. affleck .
regardless , few doubt it is high time that she won an oscar .
while her fellow competitors have all gamely shown up to support their films , ms. davis owns the category .

early in the season , the momentum seemed to be behind â€œ toni erdmann , â€ a german satire with a run time of nearly three hours that thrilled critics .
but that is long to sit through for a foreign film , especially for voters watching screeners .
after france â€™ s entry , â€œ elle , â€ failed to be nominated , energy seemed to shift to sweden â€™ s â€œ a man called ove .
â€ but then came the white house travel ban , which drew attention to iran â€™ s much lauded entry , â€œ the salesman , â€ by asghar farhadi , who announced that he would boycott the ceremony in protest .
mr. farhadi won an oscar for his 2011 drama â€œ a separation .
â€ this time , voting for him has become political , which will probably give him the edge .
yet the film â€™ s best picture chances are slim , thanks to the juggernaut that is â€œ la la land .
few match his skills at capturing and conveying onscreen the idiosyncrasies , awkwardness and absurdities of everyday conversation and life .
also bolstering mr. lonergan â€™ s chances : his script isn â€™ t up against â€œ moonlight , â€ which was deemed an adaptation and has passionate support .
the writers guild of america and bafta organizers deemed it original , but the academy decided it was an adaptation of an unproduced stage piece by tarell alvin mccraney , who receives story credit .

iftu mulisa , his wife , was watching at home in addis ababa with 15 or 20 relatives and friends .
there was loud cheering and celebrating , and then lilesa crossed his arms .
the cheering was replaced by silence and confusion and fear .

the islamic state â€™ s military tactics have also added to the challenge .

the defect has prompted the nation â€™ s largest automotive recall ever , affecting nearly 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles .
federal prosecutors also said last month that they had charged three takata executives with fabricating test data and fined the tokyo company $ 1 billion .
but the plaintiffs , who could gain from suing the automakers alongside takata , argue that the automakers were more deeply involved in the handling of the defect .
the plaintiffs have taken particular issue with the amount set aside for victims in takata â€™ s plea â€” a total of $ 125 million .
he said any further action against the automakers should be pursued in civil court , and approved the plea deal as is .
the shards severed most of her vocal cords , leaving her able to speak only in a whisper .
the propellant is housed in a steel container called the inflater , which in the takata case can rupture , shooting metal fragments toward the car â€™ s driver or passengers .
during testing of takata â€™ s inflaters in 1999 and 2000 at honda â€™ s own facilities , at least two inflaters ruptured , according to the filing .
the first recalls of takata â€™ s airbags did not take place until almost a decade later , when honda recalled 4 , 000 vehicles in 2008 .
the times has reported that honda and takata became aware in 2004 of an airbag explosion in a honda accord in alabama that shot out metal fragments and injured the car â€™ s driver .
the filing also cites internal documents from ford , nissan and toyota indicating that cost considerations influenced the automakers â€™ decision to adopt takata â€™ s airbags in the early 2000s , despite safety concerns .
in 2003 , a takata inflater ruptured at a toyota facility during testing , the court filing said .
takata engineers had long known that its explosive was sensitive to moisture and adopted it despite internal concerns over its safety .
the filing says that ford , honda , nissan and toyota were also aware of instances of ruptures years before any recalls .
it also mentions the german carmaker bmw and points to circumstantial evidence that bmw was similarly involved in what federal prosecutors , in their criminal complaint and in announcing the takata agreement , have called a .
a toyota representative also declined to comment .

the species lives only in the fertile waters of the gulf â€™ s northern corner .
the vaquita has been vanishing in plain sight , to the despair of conservationists who have been advising the mexican government on how to save it .
the vaquita are simply bycatch , trapped and drowned in curtains of illegal gillnets set for an endangered fish called the totoaba .
â€œ but they are fewer than leaving them with the fishing as it is .
the majority of vaquitas would remain in the wild .
â€œ we don â€™ t know whether we can catch them .

like the vaquita , the baiji , as it was more commonly known , occupied a limited habitat in small numbers and was decimated as bycatch in local fisheries .
for a decade , researchers discussed removing individual baiji to a reserve as a conservation measure .
if anything , those efforts have reached a nadir .
( even before the totoaba trade surged , legal gillnet fishing had depleted the vaquita population . )
but local fishermen argue that the new nets â€™ catches are too meager to provide a living , and the authorities have been sympathetic .
the promised enforcement also has fallen short .

when huge crowds took to the streets in recent months to demand that she leave office , they also called for the toppling of mr. lee and other corporate titans .
four other senior executives of samsung were also indicted tuesday , but not arrested , on the same corruption charges as mr. lee , and three of the four resigned .
south koreans have grown weary of endemic corruption and the country â€™ s traditional leniency toward tycoons accused of crimes .
samsung â€™ s market capitalization accounts for of the value of all listed companies in south korea , and its main unit , samsung electronics , alone ships 20 percent of the country â€™ s total exports .
mr. lee was accused of giving or promising $ 38 million in bribes to choi a secretive confidante of ms. park .
mr. lee was also accused of committing perjury when he insisted during a parliamentary hearing that he had never bribed ms. choi or ms. park .
it did not immediately comment on his indictment on tuesday .
in the south korean system , once a suspect is formally arrested , indictment automatically follows , unless evidence emerges that proves the person â€™ s innocence .
those cases are extremely rare .
ms. park was identified as a criminal accomplice in november , when state prosecutors indicted ms. choi on charges of extorting tens of millions of dollars from samsung and other chaebol by leveraging her connections with the president .
but she was protected from indictment while in office .
on tuesday , the special prosecutor , park added a bribery charge to the case against ms. choi , who is already on trial .
the four executives under mr. lee who were also indicted belonged to samsung electronics or to the conglomerate â€™ s powerful , secretive corporate strategy office .

i was captivated .
as these towns have declined , voters have often turned sharply rightward .
albi is traditionally centrist , but the same conditions of decline and political anxiety are present , too .
down another street is the last toy store , now closed , and around a corner is the last independent grocery store , also shuttered .
â€ i arrived in albi , population 49 , 000 , on a thursday evening , having driven in from toulouse , an hour away .
in the albi i had known before , people had lived in town above their stores .
centuries of accumulated living were packed inside the boulevards .
â€ my first appointment was with the town who had agreed to give me a tour .
florian jourdain wasn â€™ t exposing local corruption but the decline of the town that was hidden in plain sight .
he discovered that nearly 40 percent of the remaining shops sold clothes , and he suspected that much of the trade was with tourists .
there is no neighborhood cafe .
â€ street after street , we took the measure of the town â€™ s fragility .
i thought it was strange .
and then i started to see more and more empty stores .
i had a flashback .
it had been quiet enough to hear the birds in the centenarian plane trees shading the square .
now , it was a frigid intersection combined with a soulless pedestrian plaza .
cars whizzed past .
mr. jourdain spoke with the fervor of a disappointed suitor .
again , we were the only walkers , passing a line of closed stores .
on the rue puech bÃ©renguier we passed the last grocery store .
no more .
â€œ there are whole buildings where there isn â€™ t a soul .

to him , albi â€™ s fate was a cultural misfortune .

ms. stroh would stand outside the family â€™ s spanish mediterranean home in the manicured detroit suburb of grosse pointe in 1973 as her father , eric stroh , pretended to be a stranger as he drove by in his silver chrysler , waving a chocolate bar as temptation and beckoning her to the car .
her father â€™ s words about their finances were indeed prescient .
the stroh family wealth , at its height in the 1980s , was estimated by forbes to be about $ 9 billion in today â€™ s dollars .
the strohs â€™ saga is a textbook example .
bernhard stroh immigrated to detroit from germany in 1850 , selling his popular beer .
then the fourth generation of family managers decided the best way to expand was through expensive acquisitions and going national , buying the schlitz , schaefer and old milwaukee brands , among others .
hundreds of millions more were lost .
ms. stroh â€™ s father spent millions on antiques and collectibles , like rare cameras and guitars .
â€œ it â€™ s because you have to be really lucky within your own family .
those same storms led to the recent near disaster at the oroville dam 100 miles north of here , which cast an uncomfortable light on the elaborate and aging network of reservoirs , aqueducts , levees and pumps that funnel water to the state â€™ s 39 million people and its $ 50 billion agricultural industry .
â€œ nature has been dealing with the vicissitudes of water changes in california for millennia , â€ said brian stranko , director of the state water program for the nature conservancy , which bought the tract here , south of sacramento , in 1999 , and has long had plans to restore it .
there are concerns that new floodplains would take farmland out of production and that allowing benign flooding would reduce the amount of reservoir water available for agriculture and other uses .
â€œ but i think we â€™ re finding that there are softer paths .
the more than 180 , 000 people downstream who were evacuated in response to fears of a flash flood are back home .
repairs at oroville alone could run in the hundreds of millions of dollars .
by producing more rain and less snow in the mountains , atmospheric warming will also alter the amounts and timing of the runoff that fills the reservoirs behind dams like oroville .
operators may have to release more water earlier in the year .
at dams , like oroville , that generate electricity , the rules on water releases are set for several decades as part of licensing requirements of the federal energy regulatory commission , known as ferc .
when the wet season ends , the tract should drain and dry out , although there still may be occasional flooding in parts of it .
a more deliberate experiment is taking place about a miles to the east , at another conservancy plot on the cosumnes river .
the flooding can be a nuisance nonetheless .
for days at a time over the last month , michael eaton , a former official with the nature conservancy who has a small farm at his home in galt , has had to leave his car on one side of a flooded driveway and paddle a canoe a couple of hundred feet to reach the property .
not far from mr. eaton â€™ s home , the conservancy bought a plot along the river , called punched a hole in a levee to turn it into a floodplain and planted native vegetation as part of the restoration effort .
among other things , they have measured a significant amount of water returning to aquifers .
he traces it to the 1980s , when corporations under pressure to raise quarterly profits started shedding â€œ noncore â€ tasks .
that is 24 million jobs , nine million more than 10 years ago .
in retailing they earn 9 .
outsourcing does away with such considerations .
apple is as successful as g. m. was in its time .
but it employs fewer than 70 , 000 people in the united states .
jobs in coal mining and hydraulic fracturing â€” even shipbuilding â€” have been siphoned off .

why the sudden shift ?
the other key statistic spurring his adjustment : $ 54 billion , the amount of federal funding he hopes to siphon from other departments to increase spending at the pentagon â€” a budget proposal that is already on arrival , judging from its lukewarm reception on capitol hill this week .
while that statement was meant as a challenge to his establishment critics , it also seemed as if he were coaching himself .
since his inauguration , mr. trump has , for starters , picked a fight on twitter over arnold schwarzenegger â€™ s â€œ celebrity apprentice â€ ratings , declared that negative polls and news are fake , raged against his own intelligence agencies over leaks and spun a tale that millions of illegal voters cost him the popular vote .
on tuesday night , he had a script .
he largely stuck to it .
he performed a version of his campaign persona â€” the circles , little riffs .
â€ ) the father of chief owens earlier refused to meet with mr. trump , insisting on an investigation into the death .
but if you skew the publicity , you skew the impressions .
put â€œ immigrants â€ and â€œ kill â€ in the same sentence often enough and people hear , â€œ immigrants kill .
â€ but not that united .
that has happened before .
â€œ at the right time , â€ he told nbc â€™ s â€œ today â€ during the campaign , â€œ i will be so presidential , you will be so bored .
on tuesday night , however , mr. trump declared , â€œ the time for trivial fights is behind us .
only hours before his address , mr. trump had broken from his tough immigration stance in remarks at the white house , suggesting that legal status be granted to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious crimes .
republicans interrupted dozens of times with standing ovations , although democrats mostly sat .
â€œ the time for small thinking is over , the time for trivial fights is behind us , â€ he said .
â€œ from now on , america will be empowered by our aspirations , not burdened by our fears .
by this point in his presidency , mr. obama had established an active â€” if not always friendly â€” working relationship with a democratic congress , having signed into law a $ 787 billion package of spending and tax cuts intended to stabilize the economy .
â€œ very nice .
the standard could apply to virtually any of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally .
â€œ you and your republican allies in congress seem determined to rip affordable health care away from millions of people who most need it , â€ mr. beshear said .
â€œ this isn â€™ t a game .
it â€™ s life and death for people .
instead , he suddenly opened the door to an immigration bill that would potentially let millions of undocumented immigrants stay in the country legally .
â€ and then there was that immigration trial balloon .
â€ whether this was all an intentional distraction remained unclear by the time he wrapped up and headed back down pennsylvania avenue .
but the conversation took a surprising turn when some of the anchors asked about his efforts to deport many of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally .
he told the anchors it was time for a bill that would grant legal status to many of those in the country illegally as long as both sides compromised , similar to the legislation sought but never passed by george w. bush and barack obama .
that the proposal did not ultimately make it into the speech may speak to the influence of mr. bannon â€™ s wing .
thinks he is : becoming a â€œ statesman .
â€ i think it â€™ s the first time he acted presidential , but he has to concentrate on a few items .
the united states has been trying to be all things to all people .
in the meantime , we have left our own people behind .
i am pumped up .
i hope he can do it .
and this guy , whether we like him or we don â€™ t , he is the only guy who is an outsider , and today he acted like a politician .
thinks he is : unrealistic and a ball of contradictions .
who was that unmasked man ?
i don â€™ t think it â€™ s that simple .
he talks about a great health care system and covering conditions , and also talks about the disaster of obamacare .
and he talks about saving the jobs of the coal miners , but also increasing natural gas production .
i think it â€™ s oversimplified .
it can â€™ t all be true .
it â€™ s simplistic and unrealistic .
victims of crime are victims of crime no matter how or who .
thinks he is : â€œ a problem solver .
that was wonderful to see .
that â€™ s what we want to see .
thinks he is : â€œ a problem .
he didn â€™ t rage about anything .
and i think he achieved that .
i was very impressed with what a speech he had .
i think it was very authentic .
i think the man â€™ s a true patriot for our country .
i particularly liked his closing remarks .
and i think that â€™ s what his job â€™ s all about , and i think he thinks that , too .
his job is to represent the u. s. in the world and to protect us and defend us according to our constitution , and uphold our laws .

investors , attracted by snapchat â€™ s hold on its millennial users â€” who check the app on average more than 18 times a day â€” flocked to the initial public offering , pushing the parent company , snap inc. to a valuation of nearly $ 24 billion .
those buying into snap â€™ s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company , based in california .
yet when snap begins trading on the new york stock exchange on thursday , under the ticker name snap , it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of facebook , which earned $ 10 billion last year .
after a nearly road show for investors that spanned the country and stretched to london , demand for snap shares proved robust .
evan spiegel , 26 , a snap founder and its chief executive , has played down comparisons to the facebook billionaire mark zuckerberg and has assiduously painted an image of himself â€” a fashion aficionado with a supermodel fiancÃ©e â€” that is different from mr. zuckerberg .
chief among the imitators is facebook , whose instagram service has forthrightly adopted those elements .
even smaller social networks like medium , a service , have rolled out similar offerings .

mr. macron , 39 , is currently the favorite to defeat ms .

but her legal difficulties , for now , have hardly dented her standing in the polls â€” partly because she has never cultivated an image of virtue , and partly because her principal adversary is the european parliament in strasbourg , in which she sits and which is widely unpopular , especially among her supporters .

1468,18934 , scientists say canadian bacteria fossils may be earth â€™ s oldest - the new york times , new york times , carl zimmer,2017-03-02,2017.0,3.0 , , '' they are microscopic artwork : tiny tubes and long filaments , strange squiggles etched into some of the most ancient rocks known .
on wednesday , researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered , the remains of bacteria thriving on earth not long , geologically speaking , after the very birth of the planet .
martin j .
van kranendonk , a geologist at the university of new south wales , called the patterns in the rocks â€œ dubiofossils â€ â€” structures , perhaps , but without clear proof that they started out as something alive .
heated disputes are nothing new in the search for the earliest life on earth .
other researchers later argued that the structures were just oddly shaped minerals .
there is now solid evidence of life dating back about 3 .
5 billion years .
earth was a billion years old by then , and scientists have long wondered if even older fossils might be found .
in august , dr. van kranendonk and his colleagues reported discovering fossils in greenland dating back 3 .
7 billion years .
the scientists argued that the organisms were once mats of bacteria that grew in shallow coastal waters .
geologists surveyed the formation for the first time in the 1990s .
researchers have variously estimated its age at 3 .
77 billion years or 4 .
22 billion years â€” just 340 million years after the formation of the planet .
the tubes and other structures in the rock that mr. dodd found are also reminiscent of bacteria that live today around hydrothermal vents .
such a discovery could have big implications for the understanding of life â€™ s early evolution .
if these really are fossils 3 .
77 billion years old , then they show that life was already diversifying by that time , thriving in both the shallow ocean in what is now greenland and the deep ocean in today â€™ s canada .
and if these are fossils 4 .
2 billion years old , then scientists will have evidence that life began quickly on earth , not long after the oceans formed .
yet frances westall , the director of research at the de biophysique molÃ©culaire in orlÃ©ans , france , isn â€™ t convinced these are fossils at all .
3 billion years , and these are far smaller .

1469,18935 , baseball â€™ s too slow .
here â€™ s how you fix it .
the average game last season took three hours .
playoff games are even more trying , now often stretching beyond three and a half hours .
so what should be done ?
we invited our reporters and readers to submit proposals .
here â€™ s a selection ( add your ideas in the comments section ) : major league baseball wants more action and less downtime during games .
cut every commercial break by 30 seconds .
want more people to watch in the postseason ?
insist that fox show the league championship series on its regular network , not on the fox sports 1 .
october will mark the 30th anniversary of the last world series game held in the afternoon .
no kiss cams .
no stretch .
you want to sing â€œ take me out to the ball game , â€ or , worse , â€œ sweet caroline â€ ?
do it on your own time .
as for the players : no relaxing .
no chatting .
no being nice to your opponents .
no doing that thing where you waste time knocking the dirt out of your shoes with your bat for good luck , or whatever .
suck it up .
cap the games at five innings .
imagine a basketball player has just entered the action .
but before play resumes , the coach strolls to midcourt to discuss strategy with her .
a preposterous idea , of course , but that happens in baseball every time there is a pitching change , and often when there is not .
that â€™ s what catchers do with regularity .
but there is no need for it .
they have signs .
if they can â€™ t keep the signs straight , then practice more .
that should be on them , and not on the fans who suffer through the endless mound visits .
imagine : our sainted christy mathewson , â€œ the christian gentleman , â€ twirling against those shifty triplets , tinker and evers and chance â€” forever .
alas , this can not be .
forgive me , dear readers of the female persuasion , for my coarse language .
but this can not stand .
your humble scribe suggests the following .
prohibit the spitting , the tugging of nether regions and other unseemly habits that waste time and offend refined sensibilities .
finally , a more radical idea : cut down on television commercial breaks , especially when they are longer during national broadcasts .
a .
â€” james wagner ban all armor and padding on batters â€” it â€™ s an unfair advantage and wastes thousands of minutes as straps are adjusted between pitches .
the penalty for stepping out : a strike is called .
take a seat â€” automatic strikeout .
institute a pitch clock and strictly enforce it ( a ball is called if the time expires ) .
any pitcher going over the clock more than five times is ejected , as with fouling out of a basketball game .
my advice is to shorten the game .
no , i mean , really shorten the game .
reduce it to seven innings from nine .
the scourge of serious arm and shoulder injuries would very likely diminish .
not having to rely on mediocrity before getting to the studs would also quicken the pace of games .
â€” harvey araton baseball is timeless , and often endless : enduring truths my friends and i came to appreciate as mets fans in the empty upper decks of shea stadium in the early 1980s .
ah , the color schemes .
â€¦ my mind is clearer now .
so i â€™ ll acknowledge that i like pitch and innings clocks .
if batters haven â€™ t adjusted gloves and cups , it â€™ s too late to start once they step into the batter â€™ s box .
i â€™ d limit coaching trips to the mound .
otherwise , leave the beautiful game alone .
2 .
thanks for nothing .
the giants â€™ closer was happy to oblige , firing in another strike as gant frantically raced back to the plate .
there were plenty of words exchanged , but beck ultimately retired gant on a to preserve a victory .
laugh all you want about the thought of pitchers letting things rip regardless of whether the batter is in the box , but that game was over in 2 hours 16 minutes , and gant probably thought twice for the rest of his career about calling a timeout .
â€” benjamin hoffman i don â€™ t want less baseball .
i want less nonbaseball .
stepping out of the batter â€™ s box to call a timeout , peer vaguely down the line or scratch or adjust oneself is not baseball .
stay in the box .
fondling the rosin bag or chatting with your catcher is not baseball .
pitch the ball .
a visit to the mound ?
let â€™ s not .
â€” victor mather several of our readers defended the game and its slow pace , claiming that the problem lay with the attention span of today â€™ s viewers .
fix baseball ?
baseball doesn â€™ t need fixing !
oh , you in a hurry ?
what are you ?
shorten the game ?
please .
or a football game .
now , leave it alone !
and how i miss the doubleheaders !
may i suggest therapy for those sorry , frantic fans who have lost touch with their inner selves ?
go to england and watch a cricket test match .
go to norway and watch their â€œ slow tv .
â€ life is short .
the calmer you are , the slower things are , the more life you have .
don â€™ t fix baseball , fix your souls !
breathe !
baseball isn â€™ t checkers , it â€™ s chess !
otherwise , leave baseball alone !
â€” barbara ames , ponte vedra beach , fla .
the majority of our respondents agreed that baseball was too slow and offered their opinions on how to fix it .
shorten the game to seven innings ( like various youth and scholastic leagues ) 2 .
start hitters with a count ( like some recreational softball leagues ) 3 .
â€” jacob ritvo , palo alto , calif. **** fewer commercial breaks .
commercials add another 45 minutes to an hour to a game !
i â€™ m there to watch baseball .
that is why i bought a ticket â€” to view a live sporting event .
i did not purchase a ticket to wait around for a commercial break on tv .
they don â€™ t loosen up that fast , dudes !
this is also associated with the batters stepping out of the box after every pitch , a practice that should be prevented .
â€” gabriella howard , augusta , me .
have that man be bartolo colon .
â€” robert azar , brooklyn **** every time there â€™ s a pause in the game ( a manager â€™ s visit to the mound , a catcher â€™ s visit to the mound , replay review , etc . )
â€” rebecca thorsness , providence , r. i .
**** abolish the abominable rule in the majors and minors .
â€” nelson hernandez , austin , tex .
the easy answer is to blame the players .
and certainly they deserve some of it .
but i believe that before commercial tv got involved , the time between innings was a lot shorter than it is now .
with 17 changeovers in a full game , that really lengthens a game .
but before we add a clock on the players , let â€™ s think about putting the clock on those who are off the field â€” managers and tv broadcasters .
inspect photos so the zones match what ted williams faced in 1941 .
violations are errors .
â€” robert larose , taiwan **** relegation !
not so with m. l. b. isn â€™ t it ironic ( moronic ? )
so if i understand this , they â€™ d rather have the dollars than the fans .
.
this wouldn â€™ t speed up the game , but it would add some excitement .
sure , we â€™ d have to consider stats and records from prior eras as distinct from current player accomplishments .
and , yeah , keep the hitters in the box between pitches , too .
here is my idea , and it â€™ s radical for sure .
we need more offense .
more excitement .
let the best players put the bat in their hands against the best relievers at the most important times .
â€” doug tumen , woodstock , n. y .
and that problem is spitting !
spitting !
spitting !
i don â€™ t enjoy watching grown men , nor anyone for that matter spitting !
it â€™ s not pleasant , it â€™ s not cool as most players and think it is and it â€™ s certainly not .
tv producers have an affinity for showing it but it needs to stop .
â€” william mcgrady , piscataway , n. j .
â€” larry sternbach , marlboro , n. j .
aside from providing ultimate consistency and fairness to both pitchers and batters ( and fans ) the electronic strike zone would eliminate the hidden , gamesmanship practiced by pitchers , batters , catchers and bench jockeys as they try to influence the umpires â€™ calls .
â€” andreas lord , brookline , mass .
batters are supposed to stay in the box , and mound visits are limited to 30 seconds .
the umps and baseball need to actually , and consistently , enforce this .
average time saved : 98 seconds .
2 .
average time saved : 21 minutes .
3 .
average time saved : 36 minutes .
4 .
average time saved : 38 minutes .
5 .
average time saved : 39 minutes .
6 .
average time saved : 56 minutes .
7 .
average time saved : 58 minutes .
8 .
average time saved : 78 minutes .
9 .
average time saved : 81 minutes .
10 .
the season is reduced to 12 games .
average time saved : infinity , as baseball dies .
â€” robert nussbaum , fort lee , n. j .
outfielders must stay in the outfield .
this is before the pitch .
and , all tickets should be set aside for those games , so a box seat that might normally go for $ 150 would be only $ 15 and $ 20 seats would be $ 2 .
â€” rick dorfman , boca raton , fla. **** nine innings , nine positions .
â€” tom jones , boulder , colo. **** drop the fourth inning .
â€” john connolly , rockville centre , n. y .
**** we were a little surprised at how passionate people were about this subject and how much thought they put into it â€” we received nearly 3 , 000 submissions .

on thursday , the white house confirmed that mr. flynn had his own previously undisclosed meeting with the ambassador in december to â€œ establish a line of communication â€ between the incoming administration and the russian government .
the house intelligence committee has also opened an inquiry into whether russia tried to influence the election .

mr. kislyak echoed his government â€™ s line that it was not involved in hacking .
â€œ i personally have been working in the united states for so long that i know almost everybody .
he became the first russian representative to nato and was ambassador to belgium from 1998 to 2003 .
he was appointed ambassador to washington in 2008 .
some russian foreign policy experts compared him to anatoly f. dobrynin , the soviet ambassador to washington from 1962 to 1986 and a political player in both capitals .

the navy swelled from 245 ships in 1916 to a peak of over 6 , 000 during world war ii , downsizing between conflicts and bulking up during the korean and vietnam wars .
from the 1970s , the navy gradually began to shrink to a total battle force of 275 ships as of september 2016 .
but that fleet includes 10 aircraft carriers , 22 cruisers , 63 destroyers , 11 amphibious assault ships and 68 submarines , 14 of which are armed with nuclear warheads .

senator rand paul , a kentucky republican who has criticized the repeal bill , also tried and failed to see it .

but , as of thursday , they were determined to move ahead .
ever since mr. obama signed the law in march 2010 , republicans have been trying to uproot it .
when congress convened this year , republicans thought they could achieve their goal with a quick strike on the law , which has provided insurance to some 20 million americans .
polls show the law has become somewhat more popular as mr. trump and congressional republicans try to kill it .
stephen k. bannon , mr. trump â€™ s senior adviser , is pressing the president to officially pull the united states from the landmark accord , according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate .
although ms. trump has not spoken out publicly for action to combat climate change , proponents and opponents of such action see her as an ally .
the actor and activist leonardo dicaprio even slipped her a dvd copy of his documentary .

on thursday he was flown by helicopter to the courtroom , where he sat in a wheelchair and smiled at supporters from the defendant â€™ s cage .
he suggested that mr. mubarak might want to go to his palatial villa at the red sea resort of sharm el sheikh , which was the subject of a different , failed corruption case .
thursday â€™ s ruling confirmed that acquittal , prompting renewed speculation that mr. sisi might release mr. mubarak from detention , though it could prove politically awkward .
after a list of charges against the former president was read aloud in court on thursday â€” quite possibly for the last time â€” he responded curtly : â€œ it did not happen .

1487,18955 , '' if obamacare exits , some may need to rethink early retirement - the new york times '' , new york times , austin frakt,2017-03-06,2017.0,3.0 , , '' here â€™ s another possible consequence of repealing the affordable care act : it would be harder for many people to retire early .
americans reaching 65 become eligible for medicare .
before reaching that age , some can get retiree coverage from their former employers .
if early retirees are poor enough , they could turn to medicaid .
this consequence is called job lock â€” the need to maintain a job to get health insurance .
though not all studies have found evidence of job lock in the era , a majority of studies have .
that â€™ s the conclusion of systematic reviews conducted by the government accountability office and several health economists .
another study found a smaller effect , 47 percent .
but that study also found that workers in poor health who had retiree health benefits were 88 percent more likely to retire early compared with similar workers lacking retiree health benefits .

another study , examining married men , estimated smaller effects , between 10 and 15 percent .
similarly , spikes when workers turn 65 and obtain medicare coverage .

whether obamacare did that is less clear .

this may have raised doubts in workers â€™ minds about the wisdom of relying on it as a substitute for coverage .

even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow , turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts , you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $ 34 billion .
michael nathanson , senior research analyst at moffettnathanson , described snap as a â€œ field of dreams .
6 million in 2016 and $ 372 .
9 million the year before , according to the prospectus it filed in february .
so let â€™ s be generous and ignore profit .
a valuation of $ 34 billion is about 84 times revenue .
that â€™ s six times as high as facebook â€™ s ratio , which is 14 .
it â€™ s 14 times as high as google â€™ s parent , alphabet , which trades at just over six times revenue .
amazon trades at a mere three times .
even netflix trades at seven times .
by the end of 2016 , snapchat had 158 million daily active users .
by comparison , instagram , probably the closest comparison and a formidable competitor to snapchat , had about 30 million users when facebook bought it in 2012 for what was then considered an price of $ 1 billion .
( facebook had earlier tried to buy snapchat for $ 3 billion , which its founders rejected â€” wisely , it now appears . )
and $ 1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for snap .
at $ 215 each , the instagram app alone would be valued today at $ 64 .
5 billion .
â€œ it â€™ s not about economics .
â€ but snapchat â€™ s growth slowed sharply in last year â€™ s fourth quarter â€” just about the time instagram started its own version of stories , a popular snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos .
it added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters .
unless it can break out of its youthful demographic , it may already be reaching an upper limit .
that â€™ s a little over 70 million .
it â€™ s currently generating an average of $ 5 .
8 billion in 2018 .
mr. gold said some investors were buying into the i. p. o. but not to hold snap for the long term .
â€œ it â€™ s engaging , and it â€™ s fun , especially for young people .
â€œ i â€™ m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time , if ever , before they see any meaningful appreciation .

boosters of snap â€™ s prospects argue instead that snap has the potential to become less like twitter and more like its biggest rival , the $ 395 billion facebook .
snap raised $ 3 .
more than 217 million shares traded on thursday , as some investors bought and others cashed in , exceeding the number of shares snap sold in the i. p. o .

just last month , the legislature approved a tax increase that would have raised more than $ 1 billion to help narrow the budget gap â€” a bold rejection of mr. brownback â€™ s vision .
in the end , the governor vetoed the measure , and he barely survived an override attempt .
the school funding ruling now adds yet another layer of fiscal trouble for kansas and political tumult for mr. brownback .
current budget deficits reach into the hundreds of millions .
he also said the ruling was an indication that the political winds in kansas had shifted against mr. brownback , particularly with a more moderate legislature voted into office in november , when democrats gained 13 seats .

uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks , after a former employee published an account of her year at the company , which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination .
lyft has long been the underdog to uber .
in august , lyft held discussions with general motors , apple , google , amazon , uber and didi chuxing about selling itself .

it took a tornado for dean vaske â€™ s father , art , to retire and move into town .
yet he admits that his father â€™ s lack of succession planning ( the farm was ultimately left in the control of mr. hogan â€™ s mother when his father died ) was not ideal , limiting what mr. hogan and his brothers can now do with the land , which is still owned by his mother in a trust controlled by a law firm .

greyball was approved by uber â€™ s legal team .
greyball and the vtos program were described to the new york times by four current and former uber employees , who also provided documents .
at the time , uber had just started its service in portland without seeking permission from the city , which later declared the service illegal .
but unknown to mr. england and other authorities , some of the digital cars they saw in the app did not represent actual vehicles .
and the uber drivers they were able to hail also quickly canceled .
uber has long flouted laws and regulations to gain an edge against entrenched transportation providers , a modus operandi that has helped propel it into more than 70 countries and to a valuation close to $ 70 billion .
â€ uber , which lets people hail rides using a smartphone app , operates multiple types of services , including a luxury black car offering in which drivers are commercially licensed .
but an uber service that many regulators have had problems with is the version , known in the united states as uberx .
uberx essentially lets people who have passed a background check and vehicle inspection become uber drivers quickly .
after the authorities caught on to what was happening , uber and local officials often clashed .
uber has encountered legal problems over uberx in cities including austin , tex .
eventually , agreements were reached under which regulators developed a legal framework for the service .
enforcement officials involved in sting operations meant to catch uber drivers would sometimes buy dozens of cellphones to create different accounts .
when someone tagged this way called a car , uber could scramble a set of ghost cars in a fake version of the app for that person to see , or show that no cars were available .

the eight men facing execution â€” four black and four white â€” are among 34 death row inmates in arkansas , where capital punishment has been suspended since 2005 over legal challenges and difficulty in acquiring the drugs for lethal injections .

but when we arrived in manimala , i was shocked : the great river had become a trickle .
â€œ sand mafia , â€ my wife â€™ s cousin thambichan answered .
the sand acted as an aquifer , regulating the river â€™ s flow .
apartment towers , highways , bridges , skyscrapers , metros , dams : each of them swallows unimaginable helpings of sand .
with nearly all the sand removed from the river , the water table had dropped for miles around .
along the river â€™ s route , several major bridges faced collapse , because the loss of sand had weakened their foundations .
and the politicians â€” sometimes , it â€™ s rumored , even chief ministers of major states â€” who take their cut and maybe even run operations of their own .
the mckinsey global institute calculated that the hundreds of millions of indians migrating from villages to cities require up to a billion square yards of new real estate development annually .

now that sand mining has wiped out the groundwater , those same homeowners have to hire different trucks â€” tankers â€” to bring them drinking water , at more than 1 , 200 rupees a trip .
instead , according to local accounts , the authority sold much of the farmland to private developers for 10 or 30 or even several hundred times what they â€™ d paid the original landowning farmer , and greater noida became a reservoir for population overflow from new delhi .
now , capital in hand , he was starting his own development , an â€œ â€ luxury condo tower , on the outskirts of greater noida .
he had turned sand into money , and now he would turn that money right back into something concrete .
it was and .

scores of times .
that sort of thing .
every billboard we passed was an advertisement for a condominium .
â€œ they feel that beauty is a beast , â€ the architect b. r. ajit told me ruefully .
the law encourages this tendency .
many of the condos in greater noida are bought as investments by indians living abroad , and sometimes buildings are left empty by owners who have no intention of taking residence .
finally we arrived at the floodplains of the yamuna .
we stopped to survey the deep pits and fresh tracks where sand miners with earthmovers had been working under cover of night .
the mining has shifted the course of the yamuna , destroyed animal habitats , damaged crops and threatened the purity of local groundwater , and it may be causing buildings to sink .
the truth is that with the exception of a couple of months during monsoon season , by the time the yamuna river reaches greater noida , there is no river at all .
but it â€™ s an illusion .
less than 150 miles north , nearly every drop of the yamuna is rerouted to provide water for the city .
if you walk right up to the water , what you â€™ ll find are swirls of oil , clouds of white chemical foam , animal parts , floating turds .

â€œ groundwater depletes : no problem .
river is dying : no problem .
â€ â€œ people are selfish , â€ a younger man agreed .
it â€™ s not as if we â€™ re carjackers â€” we â€™ re taking sand !
it â€™ s difficult to convince people who for generations have taken local sand for granted that , like passenger pigeons a century ago , something they had thought of as infinite is now dangerously finite .
we fire shot for shot .
the energy may change shape , but the soul never dies .
with that kind of confidence , i don â€™ t think anybody can shoot us .
there he learned all about the sand trade from a tiny but stubborn community of activist hindu monks called matri sadan .

in some cases sand mining can even be beneficial .
the catastrophes occur only when specific , vulnerable stretches of river are overmined .
rejections usually occur only because of incomplete paperwork .
but it also seemed to rely almost completely on the presence of extraordinarily vigilant magistrates .

families with little children spread quilts and pillows on the seats and on the floor .

the passenger in seat 54 , a tall , man with sharp gray eyes , had only an unreserved ticket , so he was asked to vacate the seat .
but he took the conductor aside and returned in a few minutes to the same place .
i noticed that the man sitting in seat 54 kept watching a young woman in a window seat with a little child on her lap .
the train continued its slow pace , stopping every so often at another station .
the woman with the child on her lap looked over at the man in seat 54 .
even under such filthy and uncomfortable circumstances , he couldn â€™ t resist indulging his desire to gaze at an attractive woman .
she began to look back at him with fire in her eyes .
the train was approaching a station .
two decades earlier , whenever we traveled this route and stopped at this station , my little daughter would urge me to take her out and buy some ceramic toys from one of the stalls .
we would buy the toys , and i would enjoy a cup of tea in a clay cup at a tea stall .
i took it out and handed it to him .
the other man relieved me of my wristwatch .
the watch was cheap , bought for four dollars from kmart in chicago , and there were only a hundred rupees in my wallet the rest of my money , my credit cards and my ids were safely tucked inside my shoes .
i finished the cup of tea and returned to my seat on the train .
the train started again .
her head fell forward .
the man in seat 54 leapt up and grabbed the child before he fell out .
the commotion woke up the woman .
â€œ that â€™ s why i have been watching the whole time .
the woman was dumbfounded , and so was i .
she searched for the man again but couldn â€™ t find him .
â€œ bhai , â€ she addressed me , calling me brother .
â€œ if you see that man , will you kindly thank him on my behalf ? â€ i nodded .
before i got down at karachi cantt , i searched the whole compartment for him â€” but he was gone . ''

five of the 13 victims who came forward in 1982 told investigators for the trust that they had received 12 beatings and about 650 strokes .
some of the victims received up to 100 strokes at a time for masturbating , having indecent thoughts or looking at pornography â€” beatings that caused some to faint or bleed for up to three weeks , the trust found .
the trust â€™ s report concluded that all the cases were technically criminal offenses , and yet none were reported to the police .
in britain , the claims against mr. smyth have struck at the heart of the church of england after archbishop welby acknowledged that he had worked at the elite christian holiday camps run by the iwerne trust where mr. smyth groomed the boys .

he spent the summers befriending them in elite christian camps , training them in his ultraliteralistic interpretation of the bible and guiding them toward careers in the military and the church .

1541,19014 , the lighter side of rick owens - the new york times , new york times , alexander fury,2017-03-09,2017.0,3.0 , , '' you kind of want the fashion designer rick owens to be a monosyllabic , misanthropic recluse .
it isn â€™ t simple .
there is something monstrous about his gothic garments , with their strange , disturbing proportions attenuated and exaggerated , draped like ectoplasm clinging to thin limbs .
owens appreciated the sentiment so much that he ran the phrase on his website , alongside plaudits from the rest of the fashion world .
there is , however , a disconnect between rick owens the man and rick owens the fashion designer .
( he often wears shorts and sneakers , which undermines the goth undertones . )
his spiky , sharply drawn features appear a little cadaverous .
â€œ i think there was an arch moment in the â€™ 40s in fashion , and i â€™ m thinking forward , thinking about fashion cycles â€” that â€™ s kind of a good cycle to bring back .
â€ but there â€™ s something unexpectedly soft about owens , both the man and his clothes .
in person , he â€™ s preternaturally tanned ( he holidays in the united arab emirates , â€œ the shortest flight to the most sun â€ ) and his voice , a languid californian drawl , redolent of the state where he lived until the age of 42 , softens his doomsday portents .
it adds both a humanity and a note of wry humor that collapses any perceived pretension .
and in person , those clothes collapse too , in on themselves , softly wrapping the body in protective layers of felted fabric and down padding .
up close , his arch silhouettes prove light and pliable to the touch , seductive .
owens â€™ s technique has stealthily proved just as influential .
balenciaga probably didn â€™ t compare an especially visceral bunch of drapery to anal prolapse , as owens has .
but then he also , to my knowledge , didn â€™ t confess to an interviewer that he dyes his own hair .
owens is 55 , and was born in porterville , calif. a small city in the san joaquin valley .
â€œ but then i didn â€™ t think i had it in me .
i didn â€™ t think i had the intellectual stamina for it , so i decided to be a fashion designer , because that was frivolous and easy .
â€ owens smiles wider .
and he likes to talk .
he boldly experiments with fabric and silhouette , pushing boundaries of sexuality and gender .
owens is as likely to propose a dress for a man as for a woman , but without sacrificing manliness in favor of runway novelty .
â€œ i was thinking about men â€™ s fashion , i was thinking in the â€™ 80s calvin klein , he promoted male sexuality .
.. males as an object of sexual attention .
that was what happened then , and then in the â€™ 90s men â€™ s fashion was a reaction to that and it became about youth .
it became skinny and slim and young and introspective and vulnerable .
now , what is now ? â€ he stops .
â€œ if the last cycle was vulnerability , the obvious reaction would be heroism .
â€ heroism for owens isn â€™ t about the jacket or pants .
it isn â€™ t about any clichÃ© of dressing .
( owens is bisexual . )
you seldom see anything approaching a suit jacket in his shows .
and it â€™ s seductive .
his turnover is approximately $ 140 million , paltry when compared to the luxury behemoths .
â€œ but it â€™ s hard .
he also has a substantial celebrity following , although he doesn â€™ t care about things like that .
he â€™ s often dubbed a â€œ cult designer .
â€œ which means you have a following , but you never hit the popular big time .
â€ but by his own estimation , owens is not a cult designer .
like the chanel jacket in the â€™ 50s , his leather biker jacket has become part of a uniform of our times .
owens â€™ s output is prodigious .
he also has a fur line , hunrickowens .
( from 2003 to 2006 , owens was the creative director at the french furriers revillon frÃ¨res . )
owens designs nearly every facet of a contemporary wardrobe â€” outerwear and sportswear , accessories and shoes .
or , rather , redesigns it .
his gloves sometimes have wings of leather , like dorsal fins .
he also designs furniture .
in 1994 , he started his own line , selling directly to retailers .
the only windows in his studio overlook the quiet , deserted garden of the former ministry of defense .
here , his aesthetic is complete .
i â€™ ve visited him here three times , in three different years .
eventually i understood i wasn â€™ t standing in the middle of a renovation .
she also collaborates with owens on the design of his furs , and on his acclaimed furniture line , an exhibition of which is currently on view at the museum of contemporary art in los angeles .
she walks in halfway through our discussions , clad head to toe in rick owens .
her teeth glisten with gold , her fingers are tattooed and stained black .
â€ â€œ the furniture thing is really about completing .
his father , john , a former social worker , died in 2015 , aged 95 â€” which prompted a series of introspective , somewhat nihilistic collections .
me thinking , isn â€™ t all of this stuff maybe just supposed to happen ? â€ he shrugs .
â€œ our primal urge is to procreate .
we just kill ourselves off ?
â€ these are seldom ideas connected to fashion nor ideas fashion designers willingly talk about .
in real life , the act of creation is defying death .
i think it â€™ s just that dumb and simple .
â€ â€™ â€ preamble aside , owens isn â€™ t feeling particularly dour .
it â€™ s early december , and he â€™ s planning his fall 2017 men â€™ s wear collection , which he â€™ ll show a month later in paris .
this season the theme is â€œ glitter .
the show is inspired by glam rock , full of silhouettes with a theatrical bent , a hint of bowie , possibly meeting wagner , whose music owens loves .
there are lots of operatic trains .
it doesn â€™ t contain sequins , or beading or , indeed , any glitter .
it â€™ s going to be called â€œ dirt .
â€ owens pauses .
â€œ but there is another side of me that â€™ s thinking not everybody reads those things .
â€ joy as transgression .
â€ i â€™ d argue that is precisely why owens warrants such consistent applause .
his collections deserve to be talked about , by us , and by owens himself .
then he stops talking . ''

1543,19016 , comey asks justice dept .
a spokesman for the f. b. i. declined to comment .
sarah isgur flores , the spokeswoman for the justice department , also declined to comment .

it had been revealed on wednesday that mr .
and while the justice department applies for warrants , the f. b. i. keeps its own records and is in a position to know whether mr. trump â€™ s claims are true .
â€ â€œ there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the at the time , as a candidate or against his campaign , â€ mr. clapper added .
â€ ''
â€ mr. mcgahn did not respond to a request for comment .
mark levin , a conservative radio host , had also embraced the theory recently in a push against what commentators have been calling the â€œ deep state .
during the transition , the f. b. i .
he does so without consulting some of his most senior aides , or even agencies of his own government that might have contrary information .
after setting off a public firestorm with no proof , he then calls for an investigation to find the missing evidence .
instead of what mr .
sessions did or did not do , the sunday talk shows were dominated by discussion about what mr. obama did or did not do .
he claimed that more than three million people voted against him illegally in november , giving hillary clinton a victory in the popular vote .
the times also reported that before leaving office , obama officials tried to spread information about russian meddling in the election and possible links between russia and trump associates , in order to leave a trail for government investigators .
â€ â€œ however , i think he â€™ s right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney â€” of the justice department , â€ through the special court that authorizes eavesdropping on suspected foreign agents inside the united states .
but it resonated .
he had not known ahead of time that mr .
without citing a source , he asserted that mr. obama had tapped his phones , and compared it to watergate .
his chief strategist , mr. bannon , the former breitbart chairman , flew down to florida with donald f. mcgahn ii , the white house counsel , on saturday .
at dinner , he roamed the patio , telling a friend , chris ruddy , the chief executive of newsmax media , that his claims about mr. obama would prove true .
and so he doubled down , calling for a congressional investigation .
it is unclear how long the temporary ban would last .
the new order would not affect people with green cards or those holding a valid visa at the time the order is signed .
in other cases , the rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach , like the american civil liberties union â€™ s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns .
congress , with mr. trump â€™ s approval , has erased three rules in the last month , lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration , as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. more than 25 more rules could also be erased in the coming weeks the house has already voted to eliminate nearly half .
â€œ it is unprecedented .
â€ the reversals by federal regulators are happening , at times , at an extraordinary speed .
this would effectively prevent these individuals â€” an estimated 75 , 000 a year â€” from buying guns unless they sought a justice department waiver after being rejected , given the longstanding federal limitation on the sale of firearms to individuals with known mental illnesses .
they argued that it unfairly presumed a tendency toward violence by a wide range of people with mental disabilities , including conditions like bulimia and obsessive compulsive disorder .
mr. trump signed legislation on tuesday revoking that rule under the congressional review act , which gives congress a limited window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies .
rules not subject to congressional review may still be at risk .

1552,19026 , about clint frazier â€™ s lush locks : will the yankees let their hair down ?
- the new york times , new york times , billy witz,2017-03-06,2017.0,3.0 , , '' tampa , fla. â€” clint frazier â€™ s hair is spectacular .
it is red .
it is curly .
it is voluminous .
it also seems to defy gravity as much as it defies any attempt by a batting helmet to contain it .
when frazier was acquired in july as the headline prospect in a trade with cleveland for relief ace andrew miller , he immediately made a trip to a hairstylist , as the yankees had requested , and posted photos on social media .
his current hairstyle is shaved on the sides and leaves enough locks in the back to be pulled into a man bun , which is how frazier often wears his hair when he is not on the field .
even under a cap it is for a yankee .
how to embrace tradition without being a slave to it ?

5 million women in liberia who had survived the civil war , ms. freeman had personally witnessed acts of violence so brutal she still had nightmares .
soldiers had gutted her cousin .
rebels wearing halloween masks had murdered her friends .
ms. freeman had seen it all .
â€œ we will vote .
don â€™ t worry , we will vote .
â€ and vote they did .
now , as the american women who supported mrs. clinton grapple with the whys of last november â€™ s election , the story of how , 4 , 500 miles away , the women of liberia upended centuries of male rule to accomplish what their american counterparts could not has acquired a sharp and keen relevance .
mothers saw their children kidnapped , drugged and forced to take up arms in the country â€™ s civil war .
â€œ those men want put some grona boy in the chair who don â€™ t know what we doing ?

but to women like ms. gayflor , ms. jabateh and ms. freeman , there was also no contest .

â€œ women , oh women ! â€ they yelled into the bullhorns .
5 million liberians out of the country â€™ s population of three million had registered to vote .
( she left that to mrs .
cooper . )
â€ right after ms. gayflor spoke , mrs. cooper â€” not constrained by any neutrality vows â€” shouted at the crowd , â€œ vote for woman ! â€ everywhere , the women â€™ s rallies followed the same script : ms. gayflor : â€œ women , oh women !

5 million people registered to vote , some 900 , 000 showed up at the polls .

time for the real battle .
the soccer player versus the grandmother .
in the meantime , mr. weah , honing a message explaining why he , and not mrs. sirleaf , should run liberia , settled on an â€œ educated people failed â€ theme .
just as the men fell in behind mr. weah , the women fell in behind mrs. sirleaf .
they slept on the side of the road at night , curled up on their mats .
â€œ no weah , no peace ! â€ they chanted .
except that in november 2005 , this tactic appeared to have met its match .

the house republican bill would roll back the expansion of medicaid that has provided coverage to more than 10 million people in 31 states , reducing federal payments for many new beneficiaries .
it also would effectively scrap the unpopular requirement that people have insurance and eliminate tax penalties for those who go without .

a spokesman for china â€™ s ministry of foreign affairs , geng shuang , said tuesday that china would â€œ take the necessary steps to safeguard our own security interests , and the consequences will be shouldered by the united states and south korea .
the chinese authorities recently forced the closing of 23 stores owned by lotte , a south korean conglomerate that agreed to turn over land that it owned for use in the thaad deployment .
â€ adm. harry b. harris jr. the head of the united states pacific command , announced the start of the deployment , saying that â€œ continued provocative actions by north korea , to include yesterday â€™ s launch of multiple missiles , only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy thaad to south korea .
last year , thousands of people in seongju , a rural southern county in south korea , protested when it was announced that a thaad battery would be established there .
more equipment and personnel will start arriving in the coming weeks , south korean military officials said .
the arrival of thaad equipment was announced after south korea â€™ s acting president , hwang talked with mr. trump on the phone on tuesday morning .
washington â€” the launches were failing too often .
it was a fascinating journey that took us from conferences to the inner sanctum of cyber experimentation to , in the end , the trump white house .
during that investigation , from the back of a smoky bar in vienna , we extracted the story that libya had obtained an early chinese blueprint for an atomic bomb .
( don â€™ t ask â€” and yes , the times picked up an impressive bar tab . )

like the obama officials we dealt with before them , they engaged the subject deeply and professionally .
â€ we take a somewhat different view : if america is going to have an informed public discussion about how to deal with the nation â€™ s most looming threats , this kind of investigative journalism is essential .
translations were prepared in korean and chinese , giving the story a broader reach .
the decision to intensify the cyber and electronic strikes , in early 2014 , came after mr. obama concluded that the $ 300 billion spent since the eisenhower era on traditional antimissile systems , often compared to hitting â€œ a bullet with a bullet , â€ had failed the core purpose of protecting the continental united states .
it reached for techniques the pentagon had long been experimenting with under the rubric of â€œ left of launch , â€ because the attacks begin before the missiles ever reach the launchpad , or just as they lift off .
with nukes in hand , the kims have calculated , they need not fear being overrun by south korea , invaded by the united states or sold out by china .
by the time mr. obama took office in january 2009 , the north had deployed hundreds of and missiles that used russian designs , and had made billions of dollars selling its scud missiles to egypt , libya , pakistan , syria , the united arab emirates and yemen .
it was called the .
it also began to unveil its â€œ left of launch â€ program to disable missiles before liftoff â€” hoping to bolster its chances of destroying them .
it tried repeatedly to disrupt american and south korean military exercises by jamming electronic signals for guided weapons , including missiles .
mr. obama ultimately pressed the pentagon and intelligence agencies to pull out all the stops , which officials took as encouragement to reach for untested technologies .
but by most accounts , the united states program accentuated the failures .
as a presidential candidate , mr. trump complained that â€œ we â€™ â€™ re so obsolete in cyber , â€ a line that grated on officials at the united states cyber command and the national security agency , where billions of dollars have been spent to provide the president with new options for intelligence gathering and cyberattacks .
otherwise , if a nuclear power thought it could secretly disable an adversary â€™ s atomic controls , it might be more tempted to take the risk of launching a attack .
â€œ but 30 years from now we may decide it was a very , very dangerous thing to do .

â€œ maybe we underestimated ourselves .
â€ the dutch parliamentary elections on march 15 are the kickoff for a pivotal political year in europe .
other elections loom in france , germany and possibly italy .
german parties have also sought to divert public funds provided to parliamentary caucuses .
if nothing else , european parties are gaining newly emboldened allies .
â€œ geert wilders is a hero , and i think he â€™ s a hero of the most important battle of our times , the battle to defend free speech , â€ he added , calling the situation in europe a â€œ nightmare .
the donations went to the friends of pvv , according to dutch records , a foundation covered by political disclosure rules .
he added , â€œ the i. r. s. also views a charity that is controlled by a political organization as transgressing federal tax rules .
â€ mr .
mr .
pipes has called mr. wilders â€œ the most important european alive today , â€ but has differed with him on his view of islam , though he himself has expressed inflammatory views on the subject .
dutch records also show that two american foundations paid for mr. wilders â€™ s flights and hotels on trips to the united states last year .
the travel payments were previously reported by foreign policy magazine .
few dispute the stakes .
mr. wilders and ms .
mr. horowitz disagrees , and portrays the european union as the disaster .
â€œ i always thought it was a bad idea .

on one side sits a whole foods , spinning in its vast parking lot .
the foundation spent four years studying what to do with the power station after purchasing it in 2012 for $ 7 million .
â€œ any addition should occupy the footprint of the original , so both become a whole again .
the original roofline will be visible , however , a ghost incised in the pattern of the facade .

â€ altogether , the united nations referred more than 100 , 000 refugees from around the globe last year for resettlement in the united states .
so the girls , their father , aunts and uncles abandoned their houses and ran .
more than 11 , 000 people have applied through the program , and just over 2 , 400 had been admitted to the united states by feb. 22 , according to the state department .
the undertaking has always been slow .
longer term , the obama program in central america could also be under threat because of its frequent reliance on a special provision called humanitarian parole , which allows certain immigrants to enter the united states temporarily even if they do not qualify as refugees .
some republicans who want to limit immigration call humanitarian parole an overused back door to entering the united states .
what path is left for them ? â€ ''
through his office , mr. rosenstein declined to comment .
the house intelligence committee has also opened an inquiry into whether russia tried to influence the election .
just last week , mr. rosenstein announced the indictments of seven baltimore police officers on conspiracy and racketeering charges .
â€œ i â€™ d think yes .
in announcing on thursday that he would remove himself from such a case , mr .
mr .
sessions also spoke at least twice with mr. kislyak : once at the republican national convention in july , and again at his senate office in september , two months before the election .
â€ democrats accused him of lying to the committee by not disclosing his conversations with the ambassador , and they called for the justice department to open a perjury investigation .
in answering the question , mr .
it adds up to only some $ 500 billion , hardly the best place to balance a $ 4 trillion federal budget .
and they bristle at the perceived condescension of a liberal elite that seems to blame them for their failure to acquire the necessary skills to rise to the professional class .
â€œ but he didn â€™ t want their p. c. rules telling him who to feel sorry for .
these resentments are hard to swallow on the left of the political spectrum .
could they draw back in the white voters who rejected them so soundly in november ?
these voters care less about gender rights and minorities .
they may not share liberal views on abortion rights .

what really matters is not whether the trade deficit is rising or falling .
what matters is why .
the trade deficit rose 9 .
it â€™ s in the details of that $ 48 .
5 billion gap between what the united states exported and what it imported , though , that you see why the economy is more complex than the â€œ trade deficits are bad â€ framing of the trump administration .
the trade deficit fell a great deal during the 2008 recession , for example .
the united states actually exported 0 .
the united states exported $ 1 .
3 billion more in automobiles and $ 2 .
1 billion more in industrial supplies in january than it did in december .
the details show the economic idea of specialization at work .
the $ 1 .
3 billion rise in automotive exports was paired with a $ 900 million rise in automotive imports .
the reason the trade deficit rose is that imports rose faster than exports .
but even that isn â€™ t entirely a negative .
4 billion in january , with a particularly strong rise in imported cellphones .
it is the inverse of what happened during the 2008 recession .
buying more imported consumer goods because you are making more money is generally a good thing , not a bad thing .
some exports of products were down in a few sectors where the united states has important competitive advantages .
exports of civilian aircraft â€” think boeing jets sold across the globe â€” fell by $ 611 million , and shipments of other capital goods like aircraft engines and telecommunications equipment were also down .
such sectors tend to be volatile , so these may turn out to be blips .
meanwhile , a persistent strength of the u. s. economy has been in services , but the balance of trade in services worsened by $ 5 .
3 billion .
this may reflect a rise in the value of the dollar .
for example , when travelers from abroad visit the united states and spend money at hotels and restaurants , that counts as a services export .
that number fell by $ 89 million in january .
a big piece in the rise in imports was crude oil and other petroleum products .
they were up by a combined $ 2 .
2 billion .
( exports of those products also rose , by $ 1 .
2 billion , but combined that means oil contributed to the widening of the trade deficit . )
but that seems less worrisome if you know that the price of crude oil rose 9 percent from the start of december until the start of january .
it will affect , over time , patterns of imports and exports of that product .
his staff has no defense .
so for mr. trump â€™ s allies inside the west wing and beyond , the tweetstorm spawned the mother of all messaging migraines .
last week , mr .
other hill republicans have responded with similar verbal shrugs .
this is .
but that has not quieted the uproar .
i â€™ m not here to speak for myself .

none of the men took questions .
â€ this time , the white house issued a photograph of the president signing the order alone at his desk in the oval office .
justice department lawyers said the revisions rendered moot legal cases against the original travel ban .
â€œ they can â€™ t unring the bell .
â€ congressional republicans , who were split over the first travel ban , had a more muted reaction .
homeland security officials , speaking to reporters by telephone on monday , pushed back against that news report , arguing that it was culled from public sources and excluded classified information that paints a more dangerous picture .
the proposal , which was never made formally , has been rejected as an impossibility by officials at planned parenthood , which receives about $ 500 million annually in federal funding .
providing critical health care services for millions of american women is nonnegotiable .
â€œ polling shows the majority of americans oppose public funding for abortion , even those who identify as .
she added that she had no problem with the deal because her issue with planned parenthood is with its abortion work .
until 2011 , when he announced he opposed abortion rights , mr. trump had supported legal measures allowing abortions .
â€œ i â€™ m not aware that that occurred .
i don â€™ t think that we â€™ re aware that that occurred .
and mr. spicer provided little evidence to back up mr. trump â€™ s claim about mr. obama .
â€œ terrible !
other republicans defended the impartiality of the justice department and f. b. i .
â€œ it is completely unprecedented , and it is destructive of our democracy .

1607,19086 , renting a car ?
â€œ for most people , rental cars are the least considered part of trip .
but there are several charges that tend to nip renters â€™ wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought .
assuming you haven â€™ t purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract , rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed , which usually means full .
â€œ at hertz , we do not have a mileage restriction .

an avis employee redacted it when i objected .
â€œ cars aren â€™ t getting smarter , we need to be , â€ said lauren fix , an author and automotive writer also known as the car coach .
â€œ if you have a receipt to prove you refilled , they will usually refund the fee .
these fees are usually capped .
avis charges a maximum of $ 19 .
not all electronic passes are linked , however .
â€ how early is early depends on the company , but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount .
â€ late returns generally trigger fees .
they may be subject to a $ 10 fee , through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car .
parking or traffic tickets are the driver â€™ s responsibility .
â€œ you have to be aware .

â€œ we think it â€™ s long overdue for the department of justice to announce a fully resourced criminal investigation into these crimes , â€ said jonathan greenblatt , the chief executive of the league .
â€œ i mean , these are hate crimes .
â€œ it â€™ s much more concerning when preschool children are evacuated from their classrooms , or elderly patients are wheeled out of their rehab programs , or teens are whisked out of our programs .

reforms also continually collide with a culture of infantry fighters that despite the efforts of some in the leadership , embrace a tradition of brawling , and sexual exploits .
â€œ as a whole , marines are a rough and tumble group of war dogs with a taste for the carnal things in life .
â€œ those who hide in the dark corners of the internet with a shield of anonymity and purport to be warriors are nothing of the sort â€” they are nothing more than cowards .
â€œ i tried to laugh it off , but the harassment is so pervasive that it can have a real effect .
some were photos of women clothed , and others in various states of undress , in civilian and military clothing , and often accompanied by a blizzard of lewd comments .
marine corps officials , alerted to the site by mr. brennan , contacted google and had the files removed .

he also occasionally tosses phrases toward the cadre of japanese reporters who cover tanaka .
â€ as a beginner in japanese , higashioka has modest expectations , but his baseball career might provide a good model for persistence and patience .
the yankees chose higashioka in the seventh round of the 2008 draft and lured him away from a scholarship to the university of california with a $ 500 , 000 signing bonus .
he also drove in 81 runs and posted an .
we thought he â€™ d hit some home runs , and it turned out that he did .
if we â€™ re on the same page , when he gives out that sign , that â€™ s exactly what i want .
he can also ask tanaka where he wants to throw the pitch : takamei ( high ) or hikamei ( low ) nikakoo ( inside ) or gikakoo ( outside ) .
tanaka was probably being charitable .
it was a little more difficult .
but when the family returned to the united states , there was little reason for him to speak japanese .

he can understand the language but does not feel comfortable speaking it .
you try to put those things in the background and try to be a little more .
while shigeru higashioka â€” ted â€™ s father and kyle â€™ s grandfather â€” earned a bronze star in the army â€™ s 442nd infantry regiment , a mostly unit that fought in europe , shigeru â€™ s parents and other family members were sent to internment camps .

they just endured it .

his father also noticed that his older son would leave the last morsel of his dinner on the plate , a form of japanese etiquette .

he didn â€™ t drive , so we â€™ d all load into the van and head to bemis , tenn. to pick him up .
then we â€™ d gather a few more workers and drive to the job site with our hammers and helmets , ready for a long day of labor beneath the steamy , southern sun .
mr. red kept us on our feet .
we â€™ d roll them out in a wheelbarrow to be cleaned , knocking away the mortar with a hatchet .
then , after loading them onto the back of my father â€™ s we â€™ d head to memphis to sell them to the brickyards .
my parents were not silent about the obstacles they faced as black owners in the south .
but my father worked so hard that it broke my heart .
i was worried that his body would not be able to take the labor much longer .
he suffered a major heart attack and learned he had heart disease .
the doctors commanded him to stop working , and he was put on a left ventricular assist device to keep his heart beating .
our hopes of a heart transplant went out the window .
the stroke left him with early signs of dementia , so we often had a hard time telling if he knew what was going on .
he was dead , too .
both bubba and frank had been his workers .
on nov. 14 , my father passed away .
he was 63 .
we held hands in a circle around him and sang songs from our childhood .
i was holding my father â€™ s hand when i felt his spirit leave his body .
so many times on the path toward manifesting my own musical dream , i have leaned on the work foundation he and my mother laid for us .

in the past , we thought of addiction as mostly related to chemical substances : heroin , cocaine , nicotine .
behavioral addictions are really widespread now .
how do you define â€œ addiction â€ ?
they just want you to spend as much time as possible with their products .
the compulsive playing had destroyed the rest of his life .
do we need legislation to protect ourselves ?
in south korea and china , there are proposals for something they call cinderella laws .
gaming and internet addiction is a really serious problem throughout east asia .
in china , there are millions of youngsters with it , and they actually have camps where parents commit their children for months and where therapists treat them with a detox regime .
where â€™ s the harm in this ?
if you â€™ re on the phone for three hours daily , that â€™ s time you â€™ re not spending on interactions with people .
you have an son .
are you addicted to this stuff ?
yeah , i think so .

the congressional joint committee on taxation issued estimates this week showing how much revenue the government could lose starting in 2018 under the republican bill , which the party has called the american health care act , as a result of repealing taxes on drug makers ( nearly $ 25 billion over 10 years ) insurers ( nearly $ 145 billion ) makers of medical devices ( nearly $ 20 billion ) and households ( more than $ 270 billion from taxes on earned income and investment income ) .
there was also a creeping concern about how quickly the bill was moving .

he added that the c. i .
a. is legally prohibited from spying on individuals in the united states and â€œ does not do so .

and although the c. i .

the fallout may also end up being broader .
so even if you aren â€™ t worried about what wikileaks revealed about the c. i .
a. right now for yourself , here are some tips for protecting your cellphones , televisions and internet routers .
0 .
today , about 30 percent of android users , or at least 420 million people , are on a variant of android 4 .
0 , according to google .
for owners of older devices , getting the latest software updates may not be easy .
many older android handsets , like the samsung galaxy s3 , are unable to download the latest version of the android software .
if you are in that boat , it â€™ s a good time to purchase a new smartphone â€” such as the google pixel â€” which is running the latest android software .
other than ensuring that you have the latest operating system , google recommends that android users protect their devices with lock screens and pin codes , and to enable a setting called verify apps , which scans apps downloaded from outside of google â€™ s app store for malware .
2 .
about 79 percent of apple users are running ios 10 , the latest version of the system , and only 5 percent are running a version older than ios 9 , according to apple .
in raw numbers , with more than one billion ios devices sold worldwide , that amounts to at least 50 million people running the outdated software .
not all apple devices can get the latest operating system .
apple â€™ s ios 10 is compatible with iphones as far back as the iphone 5 released in 2012 , and with ipads as old as the ipad air and ipad mini 2 released in 2013 .
if you are using anything older than those , it â€™ s a good time to buy a new device for the stronger security .
what you can do with your samsung tv with samsung televisions , the situation is less clear .
the documents mentioned programs attacking smart tvs in samsung â€™ s f8000 series , which include microphones for voice controls .
the documents published by wikileaks disclosed that a tool called weeping angel puts the target tv in a â€œ fake off â€ mode .
then , with the owner believing the tv is turned off , the set secretly records conversations in the room and sends them over the internet to a c. i .
a. server computer .
that advice might not be sufficient for addressing privacy concerns around samsung â€™ s smart tvs , because the weeping angel hack continues to control the television even when it appears to be turned off .
depending on which router you own , downloading the latest firmware update isn â€™ t very intuitive because it usually requires logging into the router .
what to do with your computer the wikileaks documents mentioned attacks on linux , windows and apple computers .
and as always , stay on guard for suspicious websites that may be serving malware . ''
but the west is not laughing .
( later called it a technical error , not a hacking . )
viewers find it difficult to discern exactly what is journalism and what is propaganda , what may be â€œ fake news â€ and what is real but presented with a strong slant .
other reports included the â€œ liberation â€ of palmyra by the syrian army with â€œ the support of the russian air force â€ an interview with former british ambassador to syria and a united states critic , peter ford and a report about a london professor decrying the fall in british living standards .
she flatly denies any suggestion that rt seeks to meddle in democratic elections anywhere .
â€œ we want to complete the picture rather than add to the echo chamber of mainstream news that â€™ s how we find an audience .
you might not agree with them , but it â€™ s important to try to understand where they â€™ re coming from and why .
â€ afshin rattansi , who hosts a talk show three times a week called â€œ going underground , â€ came to rt in 2013 after working at the bbc , cnn , bloomberg , al jazeera and iran â€™ s press tv .
â€ but there is a considerably darker view , too .
â€œ a bit of mud will always stick .
and mr. flynn , for a time , was national security adviser of the united states .
mr. nimmo of the atlantic council noted rt â€™ s small reach in germany , where angela merkel , a putin critic , is facing a tough fight , and where there are up to 3 .
5 million russian speakers .
stefan meister , who studies russia and central europe for the german council on foreign relations , agreed that â€œ we shouldn â€™ t overestimate rt .
â€ â€œ open societies are very vulnerable , â€ mr. meister said , â€œ and it â€™ s cheaper than buying a new rocket .
â€œ if you can take out the electrical grid in ukraine , that â€™ s scary .
â€ mr. pomerantsev agrees with ms. belkina that rt is not inventing popular mistrust about western democracy .

he has been sending messages over the encrypted app signal , just to be safe .
â€œ that may just be the f. s. b. , â€ mr. warner said flatly , referring to russia â€™ s primary intelligence and security agency .
he appeared to be kidding .
probably .
as republicans resist calls for a select committee or special prosecutor to oversee the matter , the democrats â€™ best hope for acquiring answers most likely remains an investigation by the senate intelligence committee , where mr. warner is vice chairman .
â€ mr. warner , 62 , has another phrase for it : â€œ probably the most important thing i â€™ ve done in public life .
â€ yet the competition for this distinction is not as fierce as mr. warner once imagined .
he sponsored a local nascar team , dabbled in turkey hunting and added a bluegrass campaign theme song .
â€ after a popular term as governor , a possible 2008 presidential run was aborted before it began , punctured by some halting moments on the precampaign circuit .
persistent speculation amounted to little , with mr. kaine instead getting the most recent call to round out a democratic ticket .
by the time mr. warner came up for to the senate in 2014 , he eked out a victory by less than a point .
in the interview , mr. warner called mr. burr a friend and declined to detail their private conversations .
other democrats have been less muted .
he has taken to deploying phrases like â€œ personal cyberhygiene â€ in conversation and discusses russian incursions into french politics with a fluency once reserved for virginia budget skirmishes .
â€ last week , a meeting with the german ambassador â€” ostensibly to discuss trade and economic policy â€” turned immediately to russia , and scarcely returned to the intended topic .
â€ for now , mr. warner has suggested , he does not aspire to anything more .
in november , he told the wall street journal that his presidential window â€œ is probably shut .
â€ but that was months ago .
the senator smiled , shrugging slightly and staying silent .
it was not yet time , it seemed , to meddle in the 2020 election . ''
there â€™ s obviously a lot of concern .
â€ but after an aide slipped mr. spicer a note , he circled back to clarify that â€œ there is no reason to believe there is any type of investigation with respect to the department of justice .
â€œ the other is an investigation .
the department has refused to do so .

the pale sands of this once forgettable port alongside the emptiness of the arabian desert have proved fertile ground for all manner of skyscrapers .

now , dubai is about to gain another landmark .
it is a totem of dubai â€™ s ambitions .

among migrant workers in dubai , tales of mistreatment are legion .
most are in debt to recruitment agents who arranged their jobs .
that â€™ s been a problem that has plagued dubai .
â€ the lawsuit mr. donis filed seeks unspecified compensation for damages and a ruling that his copyright was breached .
( mr. klaris is married to robin pogrebin , a writer for the new york times . )
â€œ this is an egregious infringement of international copyright and a sad case of sovereign bullying that deserves to be corrected .
â€ the dubai municipality did not respond to questions .
in correspondence with mr. donis reviewed by the new york times , the dubai government dismissed his complaints , noting that he received a $ 100 , 000 prize for winning the competition .
three miles away , inside the gates of za â€™ abeel park , scores of laborers apply a patina of gold to the sides of mr. donis â€™ s creation .

mr. donis , 44 , had already spent enough time in dubai to be struck by its audacity .

after her doctor notified the california department of motor vehicles last november that she should not be allowed to drive , and her license was subsequently suspended , leasing a ford edge at $ 347 a month became an unnecessary expense .
or so she thought .
she had learned the hard way what many people may not realize , even though leasing has become an increasingly common and seemingly affordable alternative to buying a car .
after her diagnosis , ms. mangel was in the hospital for three weeks and out of work for a total of five , and running short of money .
â€œ i was a mess , â€ ms. mangel recalled .
â€œ i was going through all these things and ford would not budge .
i was in tears and didn â€™ t know what to do .
â€ ms. mangel had signed a lease agreement spelling out the terms of the contract , and ending the lease early without penalty was not covered .
the rules are the rules , according to margaret mellott , a spokeswoman for ford motor credit .
ms. mangel could have returned the vehicle to the dealer , and then paid the difference between the amount owed on her payments and the value of the car if sold at auction .
but with membership and lease transfer fees , that would have also cost her more than she could afford .
â€ some lessors may demand payment of all the remaining payments , plus penalties .
if the lessee decides simply to walk away from the lease and have the vehicle repossessed , the person â€™ s credit rating will suffer .
because the entire value of the car is not being financed , the payments are less on a monthly basis than they would be if the vehicle were purchased over the same period .
that is a main reason that leasing is so popular : it lets consumers drive cars that are more expensive than those they might be able to afford to buy .
when the vehicle is returned at the end of the lease , the only additional costs are those incurred if the vehicle was driven more than the maximum mileage , any amount due for damage beyond normal wear and tear , and any fees .
the lessee may also decide to purchase the vehicle , for that contracted residual value .
under the federal servicemembers civil relief act , a person who has enlisted in the armed services and is to be assigned to a location outside the continental united states for more than six months can terminate a vehicle lease without penalty .

com act as brokers , and for a fee will try to match lease sellers and buyers .
if the family decides to keep leasing the vehicle and the new lessee meets credit criteria , no transfer fee is charged .
ford motor credit â€™ s peace of mind program allows the family of a deceased lessee , with a death certificate , to return the vehicle within 60 days of the death , and the lease obligation will be excused .
in the interim , her father covered the lease payments .
but the terms and conditions of her lease made her realize that while the payments may be lower , leasing a vehicle can be more onerous than buying one .

then , in november , international politics struck this south korean maker of skin care products .
even before the current crisis , beyond cosmetics had started to look beyond china , where it was increasingly running into problems like tougher government rules and rising homegrown competition .
an export powerhouse that began its upward trajectory decades before beijing embraced capitalist economics , south korea has long benefited from china â€™ s rise .
a growing chinese middle class embraced korean devices , cosmetics , television shows and music , often in shopping trips across the yellow sea .
all of that may be in jeopardy now .
but even before china began lashing out at south korea , the economic relationship between the industrial giants had started to shift .
this intermediary trade currently accounts for about of all of south korea â€™ s exports to china .
last year , exports to china slid 9 .
that is affecting an effort by south korea to reap more economic power from its popular culture .
several musical events featuring its performers in china have been canceled , and south korean dramas have been pulled from chinese online video services .

1648,19130 , '' indo-chinese food is hard to find , except in new jersey - the new york times '' , new york times , david shaftel,2017-03-11,2017.0,3.0 , , '' a stretch of new jersey â€™ s oak tree road is known as a destination for indian restaurants , groceries and sweets shops .
but amid the indian restaurants in the area , there are a handful specializing in the fusion of indian and chinese food native to the indian city kolkata ( formerly calcutta ) and , to a lesser extent , mumbai .
though not widely celebrated in america , food is familiar to locals and venturesome food travelers like myself .
having been an expat in mumbai , i â€™ m always looking for food that transports me back to the three years i spent there , and was intrigued when a friend told me about the inordinate amount of food in the neighboring suburban towns of edison and iselin , n. j. a vibrant little india renowned for having excellent food , a cuisine that is proof that indians can make any culture â€™ s food uniquely their own .
mr. honawar is an expert in indian food but , unlike me , not a man prone to gluttony .
on the drive from new york , mr. honawar explained to me that indians consider most other cuisines bland , so they â€™ ve created their own â€œ amped up â€ version of chinese food with added chile and garlic and prepared in thick gravies that give the dishes the consistency of indian curries .
we thought it fitting to start our crawl with the most popular dish , manchurian chicken , which we found at calcutta chinese food , a restaurant tucked in one of oak tree road â€™ s countless strip malls .
manchurian chicken employs chinese techniques , but its red gravy , heavy on ginger , chilies and garlic , has the consistency of an indian curry .
calcutta chinese food â€™ s proprietress , who would only identify herself as mrs. liu , said that dishes like hakka lo mein noodles , curry chicken and a chinese take on vegetable pakoras ( a common indian fried vegetable fritter ) are similar to what chinese people from kolkata eat in their homes .
it would be an oversimplification to say that food is solely an export of kolkata , however .
i found the most distinctive â€” and delicious â€” dish to be chinese idli at dimple â€™ s bombay talk , a casual restaurant in iselin at the other end of oak tree road , about three miles away , with a show kitchen and a mostly indian clientele .
this chinese version was fashioned into cubes and prepared in a similar fashion to manchurian chicken , only spicier , since hot green chilies were featured prominently .
after a digestive pause for buying indian groceries at the incomparable and huge patel brothers food market in iselin , we ordered garlic chicken , a vegetable and vegetable noodles with a spicy bright red sichuan sauce from the indo chinese menu at moghul express in edison , which also has full north and south indian menus and a display case crammed with dozens of varieties of multicolored , indian sweets .
the noodles were the standout , reminding me of the peppery roadside preparation i â€™ d sometimes eat in mumbai .

conservatives see many of the same problems in the republican leadership plan today that bothered them about the democrats â€™ 2010 health care bill : it extends a subsidy to help individuals buy insurance though it revokes the affordable care act â€™ s mandate that nearly all americans have insurance , it replaces the mandate with a new penalty if a consumer buys insurance after letting coverage lapse it was negotiated largely without consulting the rank and file and , they insist , its benefits could go toward people who should not receive them , like undocumented immigrants .

the gender composition of jobs matters for reasons of equality â€” fields with a majority of men pay 21 percent more than those with mostly women .
jobs that were mostly female in 2000 and have become more male are jobs .
the majority of doctors are still men , but women have become the majority in some health care specialties , including pharmacists and veterinarians .
women were hit harder â€” female employment in those jobs fell 16 percent from 1979 to 2007 , compared with 7 percent for men .

this time , the adventurers include a group of scientists run by bill randa ( john goodman ) who has his glinting eyes on a mysterious , seemingly unexplored island .
the filmmakers fold a lot of moody detail into the introductions , including real locations and the fog of war : the story takes place in 1973 and the movie was primarily shot in vietnam .
later kong movies have tried to sidestep criticism by changing the representation of the islanders while leaving beauty and the beast intact .
kong , meanwhile , at times feels sidelined , brought out every so often to wreak havoc and briefly exchange soulful looks with mason .
â€œ skull island â€ has momentum , polish and behemoths that slither and thunder .
backed by government and guns , the scientists prove to be colonialists by another name , an idea that the filmmakers bat around a bit , including in allusions to joseph conrad â€™ s novella â€œ heart of darkness .
if that weren â€™ t enough , there â€™ s also a dennis character right out of â€œ apocalypse now , â€ a loopy , grizzled survivor named hank marlow who is played by john c. reilly in charming crazy mode ( the narrator in â€œ heart of darkness is also a marlow ) .
supersizing is a default mode of the contemporary blockbuster , but in this case a kong may have something to do with his role in an evolving studio franchise featuring monsters ( a. k. a. monsterverse ) that kicked off with the 2014 â€œ godzilla .
kong is the beast we know , the beast we deny , the beast we fear , the beast we kill .
here , though , kong is no longer the beast we love , the tragic who , if he didn â€™ t always win the affections of his prisoners , achieved immortality by seducing viewers .
â€œ skull island â€ is adept at goosing you it deploys feints and frights capably amid its clichÃ©s and deaths .

independently wealthy , dreier took collecting as seriously as most people do a profession .
the show ends with objects from the peggy guggenheim collection in venice .
the daughter of solomon â€™ s brother benjamin , who died on the titanic , peggy combined the work of several visionaries in one , as an art dealer , a museum builder and a lavish shopper â€” her stated intention was to â€œ buy a picture a day â€ â€” with extremely eclectic tastes .
paintings in the show that belonged to her range from a rigorous geometric abstraction by kazimir malevich to a surrealist tableau by max ernst ( her second husband ) .
she claimed pollock as her great discovery , which he was , and still is , though the show yields plenty of other discoveries : joseph cornell assemblages , franz marc horses and cows , and splendid things by artists â€” claire falkenstein , perle fine , alice trumbull mason , maria helena vieira da silva â€” you rarely see .

the snowpack in the sierra nevada â€” a source of water once winter ends and the dry months settle in â€” was nearly twice its normal level last week .

the answer is yes , or at least probably yes .

the snowpack , a central cog in california â€™ s system of providing water to 40 million people , is ephemeral : a warm april or may could melt it away .

his office is also overseeing an investigation into whether fox news , which is owned by the media magnate rupert murdoch , failed to properly alert shareholders of settlements with female employees who had accused the channel â€™ s former chief , roger ailes , of sexual harassment .
mr. de blasio was interviewed recently by prosecutors who appeared to be in the final stages of determining whether to seek charges in the matter .
phil singer , a former aide to mr. schumer and a democratic strategist , called it â€œ absurd â€ to suggest that mr. bharara â€™ s firing had been meant to punish mr. schumer .

throughout , nixon was convinced that the agencies were conspiring against him .
in the united states , civil servants can be most influential by staying apolitical , which allows them to influence policy from within .

mr. trump , for instance , portrayed his immigration ban â€™ s legal defeat as the fault of politicized judges .

and doctors and researchers are just starting to grasp the medical consequences of zika .
â€ they can have seizures , breathing problems , trouble swallowing , weakness and stiffness in muscles and joints preventing them from even lifting their heads , clubbed feet , vision and hearing problems , and ferocious irritability .
some microcephaly cases appear so dire that experts liken them to a previously rare variant called â€œ fetal brain disruption sequence .
for some , microcephaly and other symptoms are emerging months later , as their brains , with malformations or debilitated or destroyed cells , fail to develop enough to match their physical growth .
â€œ we only know what â€™ s easy to see .

doctors advised adding thickener to her formula , but if unsuccessful , she would need a feeding tube threaded through her nose .
her husband , ronaldo , 34 , tried to reassure her .
â€ but the weight keeps piling on .
five therapists examined her .
â€œ sophia is a child with very compromised visual , auditory and motor skills , â€ concluded kyrla melo , a physical therapist .
â€œ she has no head control , she does not roll over , she does not sit .
â€ she was upset .
â€œ i think it is very wrong .
â€ sophia â€™ s parents provide any support they can .
a doctor told them bright colors might stimulate sophia â€™ s vision , so they painted their gray door and shutters pumpkin orange , changed curtains and sofa covers to cherry red , and draped sunny yellow fabric in the kitchen .
resourcefulness is second nature to them .
zika , carried by the same mosquito , was barely known in brazil then .

dr. santos asked about alÃ­cia â€™ s early brain scans .
â€œ calcification in almost all of her brain , â€ Ã­ris replied .

boko haram has chased off all the farmers , and the militants themselves have fallen victim to food shortages .

we think these are animal tracks , probably from cattle .
this is part of a camp for displaced people in a community called monguno .
they live in ragged huts in a camp that is low on food supplies .
besides farmers , fishermen have also fallen on hard times during the crisis .

all were waiting for the nigerian military to escort them back to the farms and the villages they had fled during the yearslong rampage by the insurgents here in this northeast corner of the nation .
the military and the government have proclaimed that the countryside outside maiduguri , the busy borno state capital where boko haram was born , is mostly safe now .
caught in the middle are people like idi hassan and his wife , who were in the convoy with six of their young children in his truck bed .
just weeks ago , boko haram ambushed soldiers along this very highway , killing seven of them .
much of the world associates the militants with the kidnapping in april 2014 of more than 200 schoolgirls from chibok , a small village in northeastern nigeria .
since the violence started here in 2009 , nearly two million people in northeastern nigeria have fled their homes in fear of boko haram , which has carried out a murderous spree against civilians and members of the military .

a study from the farecasting app hopper showed a significant drop in searches for travel to the united states from 122 origin countries from late december 2016 through feb. 22 .
hopper â€™ s data also shows a correlation between news media reports on the travel ban and a decreased interest in booking travel to the united states .

even so , china built a nuclear arsenal of its own , and now concerns about the effectiveness of that arsenal as a deterrent are driving it into confrontation with the united states over an antimissile system being built in south korea .
here â€™ s an explanation of why .

the united states has deployed about 1 , 370 nuclear warheads and has stockpiled more than 6 , 500 , and has submarines and aircraft able to launch nuclear weapons .
china has also built several submarines that can launch nuclear missiles .
china has also been upgrading some of its missiles so that several nuclear warheads can be placed on a single missile that then unleashes them on different targets .
â€œ the chinese more or less modernized for their own reasons and according to their own ideas .
even so , china has been expanding and upgrading its nuclear forces , and that modernization may speed up if the government feels that it is falling too far behind the united states .
â€œ what we worry about is the ability .
â€œ if there â€™ s this ability , then china must worry .

1736,19223,2 of a farmer â€™ s 3 children overdosed .
what of the third â€” and the land ?
he hadn â€™ t bargained on heroin .
then , in march 2016 , mr. winemiller â€™ s daughter , heather himes , 31 , died of an opioid overdose at the family farmhouse , inside a bathroom overlooking fields of corn and soybeans .
nine months later , mr. winemiller â€™ s older son , eugene , 37 , who once drove trucks and tractors on the family â€™ s farm , overdosed at his mother â€™ s home .
family members and medics had been able to revive him after earlier overdoses .
farm bureaus â€™ attention to seed , fertilizer and subsidies has been diverted to discussions of overdoses .
and at the end of a long gravel driveway , mr. winemiller , 60 , has been thinking about the uncertain seasons ahead .
the son dreams of taking over the farm someday .
the father is wary .
â€œ yes .
but i â€™ m a realist .
he also keeps a pouch of nasal spray in the living room now , just in case .
the winemillers live on the eastern edge of clermont county , about an hour east of cincinnati , where a suburban quilt of bedroom towns , office parks and small industry thins into woods and farmland , mostly for corn and soybeans .
apple orchards and pumpkin farms â€” now closed for the season â€” are tucked among clusters of small churches , small businesses and even smaller brick houses .
the county â€™ s unemployment rate is only 4 .
drug overdoses here have nearly tripled since 1999 , and the state as a whole has been ravaged .
in rural wayne township , where the winemillers and about 4 , 900 other people live , the local fire department answered 18 overdose calls last year .
â€ mr. moulden is a good friend of mr. winemiller â€™ s and responded to the 911 calls last march , then again last december , when heather and eugene died of overdoses .
it was a rainy wednesday , 9 a. m. time for the drive to take the younger roger to the probation office , then a more to take him to his drug treatment clinic .
the men sank into the leather seats of mr. winemiller â€™ s chevy tahoe and skimmed along the wet roads .
the younger roger â€™ s driver â€™ s license had been revoked , so this was now the routine .
â€ he added , a bit ruefully , â€œ set you up for failure .
he started working on the farm when he was 12 , driving tractors even though his father had to attach pieces of wood to the pedals so his legs would reach .
â€œ it â€™ s in my blood .
the son was starting to feel anxious and queasy .
he cracked open the car window .
their conversation curled like a river as they drove .
mr. winemiller was concerned about the low prices of crops like soybeans and corn .
the younger man pointed at the red sign of a budget motel : â€œ i used to buy drugs there .
â€ he said he had bought from dealers who drove out to the countryside for a day and set up â€œ trap houses â€ in trailers or apartments where they would sell to all comers .
he and his father talked about motorbikes , weather and politics .
he saw only disorder and lawlessness .
â€ he likes the toughness .
after his son and daughter died , he began meeting with sheriffs and politicians at forums dedicated to the opioid crisis , urging harsher penalties , such as manslaughter charges for people who sell fatal hits of opioids .
â€ paul casteel , the senior minister at the blanchester church of christ , conducted the services at eugene winemiller â€™ s funeral .
but heroin has turned that closeness on its head .
â€œ you know everybody .
to be honest , i wanted to stay out of it , just concentrate on the church .
â€ by early afternoon , the father and son , done with their appointments , climbed into the tahoe and headed home down state route 380 .
knowledge isn â€™ t in my head or in your head .
we â€™ re guessing no .
most of what you â€œ know â€ â€” most of what anyone knows â€” about any topic is a placeholder for information stored elsewhere , in a textbook or in some expert â€™ s head .
but when we told another group about the same discovery , only this time claiming that scientists had explained how the rocks glowed , our respondents reported a little bit more understanding .
the sense of understanding is contagious .
people fail to distinguish what they know from what others know because it is often impossible to draw sharp boundaries between what knowledge resides in our heads and what resides elsewhere .
this is especially true of divisive political issues .
you must rely on your community .
this may be bad policy , but most people don â€™ t have sufficient expertise to draw that conclusion because evaluating the policy is complicated .
we suspect that most of those people expressing outrage lacked the detailed knowledge necessary to assess the policy .
we also suspect that many in congress who voted for the rollback were equally in the dark .
but if we take this medicine , it can be empowering .

but this campaign has collided with closely fought local elections in the netherlands and france , where politicians have sought political capital from stoking tensions with the turks .
the push for votes also comes at a time of increased european alarm over turkey â€™ s democratic backslide and rising concerns over immigration and integration .

1744,19231 , '' after $ 225 billion in deals last year , china reins in overseas investment - the new york times '' , new york times , keith bradsher,2017-03-13,2017.0,3.0 , , '' beijing â€” china struck $ 225 billion in deals to acquire companies abroad last year , a number that signaled to the world that chinese business leaders were hot to haggle .
dalian wanda , a real estate giant that has branched out into filmmaking and cinemas , had no immediate comment .
among its moves , beijing secretly told banks in late november that any movement of $ 5 million or more out of the country required special approval .
since then , regulators have also told each bank not to move more money out of the country for clients than they take in .
china â€™ s $ 225 .
4 billion in announced deals for overseas properties last year amounted to more than double 2015 â€™ s total , according to dealogic , a data firm that tracks deals .
such limits may make foreign investors more wary of putting money into china , at a time when chinese leadership is trying to encourage more bond purchases by foreigners and other investments into the country to offset the money moving out .
in one of the biggest chinese deals to come apart , anbang insurance , a politically connected company with a murky ownership structure , abruptly pulled out of a $ 14 billion deal to buy starwood hotels and resorts .
some of the other deals involved real estate firms or gritty industrial companies that have tried to buy their way into hollywood â€” a trend that has also dismayed some in washington , who worry that china may be acquiring too much influence over american entertainment .
anhui xinke new materials , a copper processing company in central china , made a deal in november to buy voltage pictures , an american film financing and production company , for $ 350 million .
a month later , anhui xinke pulled out of the transaction before its completion .
more than $ 500 billion sluiced out of the country in the few months after the stock market plummeted in summer 2015 and before china began gradually enforcing previously dormant rules on money transfers in february 2016 .
qiang li , a managing partner for china at the law firm dla piper , said that only a quarter of the many deals in which he was involved relied on transferring money out of china and might face obstacles .

1746,19233 , '' health bill would add 24 million uninsured but save $ 337 billion , report says - the new york times '' , new york times , thomas kaplan and robert pear,2017-03-14,2017.0,3.0 , , '' washington â€” the house republican plan to replace the affordable care act would increase the number of people without health insurance by 24 million by 2026 , while slicing $ 337 billion off federal budget deficits over that time , the nonpartisan congressional budget office said monday .
â€œ this should be a looming stop sign for the republicans â€™ repeal effort .
in a sign of the concern over the coverage projections , senator susan collins , republican of maine , said the budget office â€™ s report was â€œ cause for alarm â€ and â€œ should prompt the house to slow down and reconsider certain provisions of the bill .
â€ average premiums for people buying insurance on their own would be 15 to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019 than they would be under current law , the budget office said .
the budget office estimated that 52 million people would be uninsured in 2026 under the house republican bill , compared with 28 million projected under current law .
by contrast , a earning the same amount would fare much worse .
its director , keith hall , was appointed in 2015 by congressional republicans , and it is generally respected for its objective analysis .
â€ he added , â€œ sometimes we ask them to do stuff they â€™ re not capable of doing .
while people would not face a penalty for not buying insurance , republicans would put in place a new provision to encourage continuous coverage : people would face a 30 percent surcharge in their premiums if they signed up for insurance after having gone without it for about two months or more .
in an interview last week with the radio host hugh hewitt , mr. ryan played down the significance of the forthcoming coverage estimate .
â€œ and when you replace that with , â€˜ we â€™ re going to have a free market and you buy what you want to buy , â€™ they â€™ re going to say not nearly as many people are going to do that .
they â€™ ll be able to pick the doctor they want .

they warned that these would also be â€œ poison pills â€ that could kill any potential deals to keep the gears of government running normally this year .
â€œ so it â€™ s a complicated program .
â€ mr. mulvaney orchestrated a government shutdown in 2013 as a republican member of congress .
republicans , who have 52 seats in the senate , will need 60 votes to pass a budget .
democrats flirted with a government shutdown over health benefits to retired miners last year before backing down at the last minute .

beyond that , schumer told me : â€œ i bump into him at meetings here and there .
i sort of knew him .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ schumer kept up appearances .
â€ but by the early hours of wednesday it was clear that the democrats would not take the senate and that schumer would not be lyndon johnson .
the election in november left the democrats stripped of power at every level of federal authority .
â€œ i sleep like a baby , â€ chris murphy , the democratic senator from connecticut , told me .
i was , mentally , totally unprepared .
addressing brock â€™ s crowd , klain called for democrats to embrace what he dubbed the fight club .
â€œ when you â€™ re in the minority , you can â€™ t be too choosy .
â€œ at the time , there was more of a divide , â€ klain told me .
â€œ we like to govern .
â€œ i â€™ m friends with them .
they attack me , i attack them .
we understand that .
it was in this mode that he took to the senate floor , a week after the election , and drew a line .
â€œ but we also have other responsibilities .
â€ reid and schumer might have differed temperamentally , but they were both thinking about the 2018 midterm elections , in which 25 democratic senators would be defending their seats .

shortly after graduating from college , levin was hired by lloyd doggett , a democratic congressman representing levin â€™ s hometown , austin , tex .
at the time , democrats were trying to maneuver the affordable care act through the house of representatives , and organizers of the nascent tea party movement decided to mount a show of force at the town halls that representatives typically held in their districts during the august recess .
â€œ they chased him out into the parking lot , â€ levin told me recently .
when doggett tried to leave , the crowd surrounded his car .
republicans had in recent decades outperformed democrats at this kind of dispersed , activism .
but democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters â€” a support apparatus that receded sharply by the late 20th century .
but these representatives weren â€™ t really the intended audience republicans were .
did pass .
lloyd doggett did vote for health care .
but it did slow down and water down legislation .
tea party members may not have agreed on the policy reforms , but they could agree that obama , democrats and moderate republicans had to be stopped .
when the authors set up a proper website , it was viewed more than five million times in its first month â€” a testament to how closely the guide mirrored where democratic voters already were .
they were a force in search of an object .
gillibrand â€™ s stated objection to mattis was that his appointment would weaken civilian control over the military .
a demonstration in washington also drew crowds in louisville , ky. boise , idaho charleston , s. c. des moines .
â€œ and the response this time has been nothing like that .
there has been genuine activism â€” not just in the big cities but also everywhere else .
we â€™ re just trying to encourage him to be more aggressive on these issues .
â€ by the week after inauguration day , however , rallies were happening nationwide every tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge .
then , on the afternoon of friday , jan. 27 , the white house announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the united states by citizens of seven countries .
warren was at boston â€™ s logan international airport , red megaphone in hand .
cory booker was at the alfalfa club dinner â€” a cozy washington institution that trump skipped but several white house officials were , reportedly , attending â€” when his chief of staff called him from dulles international airport .
â€œ i basically bolted , â€ booker told me .
it was a strange thing to see : schumer was at the barricades , but schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy .
â€œ what we â€™ re talking about here is that beautiful lady in the harbor â€” and what america is all about .
â€ schumer â€™ s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly , and definitively , the politics of the moment had been settled .
and by the end of that week all four cabinet appointees under consideration â€” mattis secretary of homeland security john kelly mike pompeo , director of the central intelligence agency and nikki haley , ambassador to the united nations â€” sailed through their confirmation votes with no serious opposition .
he had not only declined to rally his caucus against the cabinet nominees , but he had also voted for all four of them himself .
as he was speaking , i heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of â€œ senator !
i turned and saw , gliding through the scrum in the direction of the stage , the bald dome of cory booker â€™ s head .
he was beaming , obliging fans with and back slaps .
by some measures , booker â€™ s voting record in the senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right of schumer .
but booker voted no on kelly and pompeo , and schumer did not .
booker was at the airport protests the night before , and schumer was not .
â€œ put â€™ em up for our immigrants ! â€ â€œ vote no , senator , â€ someone yelled .
â€œ no on tillerson .
no on mulvaney .
no on carson .
no on mnuchin .
â€ â€œ so it â€™ s a defensive vote ? â€ â€œ yeah .
two republicans , susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska , had announced their opposition to devos .
â€ it was odd , amid the online clamor , to arrive at the capitol shortly before 2 a. m. and find it quiet , nearly empty .
shortly after the travel ban , he tweeted : â€œ i â€™ ve never been a guy .
but i do think it â€™ s time to march on the street .
â€ after an hour , the camera cut away , and a mildly tim kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn .
â€œ timmy ! â€ schatz exclaimed .
the senate chamber has the oxygenated , atmosphere of a casino on a slow night , the same woozy contextlessness .
sitting in the press gallery as the clock inched toward 4 a. m. i began to have the strange sensation of not knowing exactly what i was watching .
â€œ fourteen democrats voted for mike pompeo , â€ ezra levin , the indivisible guide told me .
that â€™ s why you saw people outside dianne feinstein â€™ s office , outside of schumer â€™ s office , amy klobuchar â€™ s office .
and zero democrats voted for devos .
pompeo was an awful pick devos was an awful pick .
mcconnell â€™ s justification â€” â€œ she was warned she was given an explanation nevertheless , she persisted â€ â€” quickly evolved into a rallying cry , prompting nearly twice as many google searches for warren â€™ s name as her election to the senate did in 2012 .
warren ?
both of them ?
by spirits in democratic washington had palpably lifted .
trump â€™ s nominee for labor secretary , the c. e. o. andrew puzder , backed out of consideration for the job in after the republicans concluded that they did not have the votes to confirm him .
â€œ that â€™ s the three votes they need , even with 52 ! â€ schumer crowed .
it was very positive .
they throw a few brickbats , fine .
this energy is enormous .
â€ but even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many democrats , there was a gloom among the party â€™ s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in november â€” a sense that the party , buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition , was punting on resolving difficult questions , at its own peril .
but sanders did not intend to be among them .
â€œ i â€™ m not in a very convivial mood .
i don â€™ t want to pretend .
these are very , to my mind , frightening times .

they would rather go down with the titanic so long as they have seats .

the indivisible guide , in the three months since levin first posted the google doc , had birthed the organization he and his colleagues had not intended to start , with levin as the executive director .

not necessarily - the new york times , new york times , jane e. brody,2017-03-29,2017.0,3.0 , , '' people trying to lose weight â€” or not gain weight â€” are frequently advised to â€œ lay off the booze .
after the winter holidays , i often hear people blame alcohol for added pounds , not just from its caloric contribution but also because it can undermine and stimulate the appetite and desire for fattening foods .
the review , published in 2015 in current obesity reports , was prepared by gregory traversy and chaput of the healthy active living and obesity research group at the children â€™ s hospital of eastern ontario research institute in ottawa , ontario .
and in a departure from most of the other findings , some of the research indicated that for adolescents and ( alas ) older adults , alcohol in any amount may â€œ promote overweight and a higher body fat percentage .
the conclusion from the most recent such studies : while heavy drinkers risked gaining weight , â€œ light to moderate alcohol intake is not associated with weight gain or changes in waist circumference .
â€ the studies dr. chaput ranked as â€œ most reliable â€ and â€œ providing the strongest evidence â€ were controlled experiments in which people were randomly assigned to consume given amounts of alcohol under monitored conditions .
however , the experimental studies were small and the â€œ intervention periods â€ were short .
dr. chaput noted that even a very small weight gain over the course of 10 weeks can add up to a lot of extra pounds in five years unless there is a compensating reduction in food intake or increase in physical activity .
unlike protein , fats and carbohydrates , alcohol is a toxic substance that is not stored in the body .
â€œ men are more likely to binge drink and to drink beer and spirits , whereas women mostly drink wine and are more likely than men to compensate for extra calories consumed as alcohol .
â€ genetics are also a factor , dr. chaput said , suggesting that alcohol can be more of a problem among people genetically prone to excessive weight gain .
furthermore , as i and countless others have found , alcohol has a â€œ disinhibiting â€ effect and can stimulate people to eat more when food is readily available .
â€œ the extra calories taken in with alcohol are stored as fat , â€ he reminded drinkers .
here â€™ s the bottom line : everyone is different .
even when two people start out weighing the same and eat , drink and exercise the same amount , adding alcohol to the mix can have different consequences .
if you â€™ re a moderate drinker and find yourself gradually putting on weight , try cutting down on , or cutting out , alcohol for a few months to see if you lose , gain or stay the same .

in a day of â€œ â€ as the back and forth between the house of commons and the house of lords is known , prime minister theresa may finally won her parliamentary battle to start talks on britain â€™ s exit from the european union , unhindered by any legislative constraints .
the government argued that it should guarantee the rights of european union nationals only when britain received reciprocal assurances about its citizens in continental europe .
on monday night , elected lawmakers in the house of commons overturned both amendments , and the house of lords yielded by a significant majority , in line with parliamentary protocol , handing mrs. may her wish of unimpeded authority .
she is now in a position to fulfill her promise to send formal notification , by the end of the month , of the start of withdrawal talks under article 50 of the european union â€™ s treaty .
since then , mrs. may has rejected calls from ms. sturgeon for a soft brexit that would keep scotland , at least , inside the european union â€™ s single market and its customs union .
with opinion polls showing scots almost equally divided over the merits of independence , the threat of another referendum that could break the united kingdom apart complicates what was already a highly complex brexit negotiation for mrs. may .

he is not transitioning and becoming a â€œ softly spoken woman named fiona , â€ as the national enquirer claimed last summer and mr. simmons rebutted on facebook .
those are the questions that dan taberski , a former producer of â€œ the daily show â€ and a friend of mr. simmons , has turned into a cultural phenomenon with his podcast , â€œ missing richard simmons , â€ which is currently the most downloaded podcast on itunes .

he no longer sprinted out of his home to greet tour buses , delighting onlookers with his glittery costumes .

why do you think people are so intrigued by mr. simmons and the podcast ?
it â€™ s people who have been reminded or are being just told for the first time that richard simmons is a special , important and fascinating person .
and i think people feel for him .
he just exudes kindness and genuineness .
the concern is that he is not just taking time off .
he â€™ s not just retired .
he â€™ s not just stepping away from the spotlight .
the concern is that he â€™ s cut off every person he knows .
it â€™ s impossible not to be concerned about that .

since the european union first promised turkey several billion euros for its help in stemming migration to europe in late 2015 , the number of migrants leaving turkish shores had fallen to under 1 , 500 in january from nearly 70 , 000 in january 2016 .
â€ migration through turkey rose sharply in 2015 , not just because of the impunity with which smugglers could operate here , but also because it was comparatively easy for syrian refugees to reach turkey from syria , jordan and lebanon .
at the time , the land border was easier to cross , and syrians in amman and beirut could fly to turkey without needing to apply for a visa .
â€œ this seems to me like an empty threat , and it â€™ s about time europe called turkey on this , â€ mr. stein added .
5 million syrians .
in theory , some of these could also take advantage of renewed impunity for smugglers and pay for a boat ride to greece .
this did not stop onward migration entirely .

1788,19280 , how egypt â€™ s activists became â€˜ generation jail â€™ - the new york times , new york times , joshua hammer,2017-03-18,2017.0,3.0 , , '' every morning at 5:30 , an alarm clock awakens ahmed maher from his mattress below a stairwell at his neighborhood police station in cairo .
an officer then escorts him to the toilet and signs a notebook that maher carries , authorizing his release until 6 that evening .
after breakfast with his wife and two small children , he takes care of chores aimed at rebuilding his life â€” renewing his driver â€™ s license , reactivating his cellphone he visits friends and family and searches for a job in civil engineering , his occupation before he was clapped into prison .
whatever he does , he must be back at the police station before sundown .
â€ the clock is ticking .
abdel fattah the defense minister and commander in chief of the armed forces , seized power in july 2013 and outlawed protests .
another judge added six months to maher â€™ s sentence for â€œ verbally assaulting a public officer while on duty â€ after he demanded that the police remove his handcuffs while in court for a 2014 appeal .
maher spent almost all of that period sealed in a small cell in a wing at tora prison , a notorious complex on the outskirts of cairo , built during british rule , that houses about 2 , 500 political prisoners and common criminals .
today maher is nominally a free man , but the restrictions on his movements are stifling .
â€œ so if you are tweeting , you are like a terrorist .
under egyptian law , he told me , felons â€œ have the right to have their surveillance inside the home with a guard downstairs .
it is a kind of control to keep me all the time under pressure .
nidal raced to the television , switched it from the soccer match to a cartoon and then snuggled up to his father .
during his incarceration , his contact with the children was limited to short visits twice a month .
the encounters left his kids perplexed and disturbed .
â€œ i explained what the revolution was and how people protested .
and i told her that when the current regime took over , it didn â€™ t allow people to express their opinions .
sisi knew what happened to mubarak , so he didn â€™ t want them to speak out again .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ he told me .
they confiscated his books , radio and clothes , leaving him with only his thin prison uniform .
â€œ the prison officials complained to my father .
maher had to be careful with what he told me the regime might send him back to prison if he criticized sisi too harshly .
â€ yet maher â€™ s reluctance runs against all his instincts .
( at the end of mubarak â€™ s rule , the figure was between 5 , 000 and 10 , 000 . )
once described by amnesty international as â€œ generation protest , â€ the youths who took to the streets in egypt to bring down a dictator in 2011 have acquired a grim new nickname : â€œ generation jail .
.. the law .
â€œ they are overwhelmingly the children of judges , like gondoliers in venice .
in early 2016 , shehata sentenced three young members of april 6 , who were attending a memorial service for a murdered comrade when they were arrested , to life terms for protesting without a license , possessing fireworks and spreading false information .
there is no more of that kind of thinking .
thrown into a cell with 35 islamists , he slept amid a crush of other prisoners on a blanket on the concrete floor .
â€œ you need to take the word â€˜ privacy â€™ out of your dictionary if you are going to survive , â€ he told me .
they are so thirsty for revenge .
egypt â€™ s slide back into authoritarianism wasn â€™ t foreordained .
he was beaten and jailed repeatedly .
the group took its name from the date of a strike in cairo that maher organized in 2008 in solidarity with textile workers in the nile delta .
you did miracles .
but now we need you to stop demonstrating .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ maher and the others rejected sisi â€™ s request .
â€ over the next six months , maher met with sisi three times .
in europe , he talked politics and revolution with the first vice president of the european commission , catherine ashton officials from the united nations human rights council and green party and social democratic representatives to the european parliament in brussels .
â€œ we didn â€™ t have a vision , â€ admitted walid shawky , a dentist and a member of the april 6 political committee .
by the end of 2012 , egypt was in chaos .
people with hammers and knives were chasing us .
there was a lot of ugliness .
â€œ maher and the whole leadership of the movement refused to do it .
maher was arrested on nov. 30 and sent to tora prison .
though protests still take place there from time to time â€” students assembled there last june to denounce corruption in egypt â€™ s abysmal education system â€” the police quickly break them up with tear gas .
while the stability imposed by sisi has gained him wide support , he has staked his presidency on an economic turnaround that has not materialized .
tourism has collapsed , and the regime spent over $ 8 billion on a huge expansion of the suez canal , a money pit that depleted supplies and set off shortages of sugar , medicine and rice .
sisi alienated poor egyptians by raising the price of gasoline and instituting a tax to obtain a $ 12 billion loan from the international monetary fund .
â€œ we may not last until the end of the year , â€ he told me .
â€œ i hated myself , and i thought being a salafist would cure me of being gay , â€ he told me .
he had fallen in love with another fundamentalist , a syrian who jilted him and joined the refugee flood to europe .
â€œ people are terrified .
â€ ( a few days after i left egypt , my translator would seek , and eventually gain , humanitarian asylum in germany , claiming that the crackdown on gay egyptians had endangered him . )
around midnight , the host cleared furniture from the salon , and the crowd gathered around the perimeter of the room to watch the evening â€™ s entertainment .
a lithe , man danced erotically around another man swathed in a black burqa , prying apart the second man â€™ s legs and removing a beach ball , a teddy bear and other objects and tossing them around the salon .
the lewdly choreographed show , taking place out of sight of sisi â€™ s ubiquitous security forces , seemed an act of defiance .
the boy â€™ s lawyer , mahmoud al shinawy , calls the case a revenge plot against the father , an affluent businessman who had refused to submit to a police shakedown .
this is the defendant .
ahmed was sentenced to life in prison , but the verdict was later thrown out of court .
today it is a popular hangout for journalists , leftists and members of cairo â€™ s beleaguered l. g. b. t. community .
together we headed for a meeting with an original member of the april 6 movement who has also been caught up in the purgatory of sisi â€™ s courts and prisons .
he had spent five months in jail for organizing the april 2016 protest against sisi â€™ s transfer of two uninhabited islands , tiran and sanafir , in the gulf of aqaba , to saudi arabia , apparently in a quid pro quo for desperately needed hard currency , gas and oil .
( egypt â€™ s state council , in a rare display of independence , later ruled the transfer illegal . )
at the end of five months , the organizer must appear again before a judge â€” who could renew his probation or send him back to jail .
i need to have the safe feeling , so that i can organize my life again .
maher shrugged .
â€œ so it â€™ s three steps forward , two steps back .
â€ a friend picked up maher at his home , and i followed them in my car to the station .
the driver embraced maher and then motored away .
maher wore his woolen ski cap and carried a black satchel containing a novel and a dinner that reham had prepared for him .
â€œ if you go out there right now , c. p. d. is different than it was this time last year .
we â€™ re doing it .
preet bharara , the united states attorney in manhattan , refused to step down and was fired .
his counterpart in montana , michael w. cotter , resigned but called the administration â€™ s handling of the matter â€œ very unprofessional .

mr. fardon â€™ s parting message was different , raising no objection to his ouster .
instead , it was a call to address a surge of violence in chicago that has defied the efforts of police officers who â€œ in their quiet moments struggled with their own sense of frustration and despair .
â€ mr. johnson called mr. fardon â€œ a great partner â€ to the police department and said he agreed with mr. fardon â€™ s call for more prosecutions on federal gun laws .
he also addressed mr. fardon â€™ s claim that police officers had become hamstrung and too passive on patrol .
mr. fardon criticized budget cuts that have thinned the ranks of federal prosecutors .
and he called for an aggressive crackdown on social media , where people air grievances that escalate to gunfire .
â€œ i think more prosecutors and police chiefs should do what he did .

â€œ you can think of it as a musical virus .
in the case of the toy car , the researchers did not actually compromise the car â€™ s microprocessor , but they controlled the car by forcing the accelerometer to produce false readings .
they exploited the fact that a smartphone application relies on the accelerometer to control the car .
dr. fu has researched the cybersecurity risks of medical devices , including a demonstration of the potential to wirelessly introduce fatal heart rhythms into a pacemaker .

on wednesday , american media inc. publisher of the national enquirer and radar online , announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire us weekly from wenner media , which has owned it since 1985 .
for wenner media , which also publishes rolling stone and men â€™ s journal , the sale of us weekly represents a further paring of assets .
â€œ never acquire a company that you â€™ re embarrassed to tell your mother about .
â€ wenner media bought us in 1985 and turned it into a weekly from a monthly in 2000 to compete more directly with people and entertainment weekly , another time inc. magazine .
us had a rough start as a weekly , however , and in 2001 , wenner sold a 50 percent stake in the magazine to the walt disney company for about $ 40 million .
five years later , wenner media borrowed $ 300 million to buy the stake back , saddling itself with debt that has required significant annual payments .
( wenner used $ 25 million from the $ 40 million rolling stone deal last year for a special payment on the loan , according to credit reports . )
the sale of us weekly is the latest sign of wenner media â€™ s struggles .
without us weekly and its 110 staff members , wenner media will be significantly smaller .
the magazine brought in 65 percent of the $ 330 million that wenner media generated in revenue for the year that ended in june , according to a report in october from moody â€™ s investor service .

( roosevelt also admired alexander hamilton , another strong nationalist , for the similar reasons . )
â€œ that â€™ s why teddy roosevelt admired him .
in citing jackson , ms. richardson said , roosevelt generally spoke not of his racial record and what she called the â€œ incredibly racist version of manifest destiny â€ jackson promoted , but the idea that the government belong to the people , not the wealthy .

dressed in a black suit and matching converse he instructed an attendee to â€œ time me for a minute .
â€ as the countdown commenced , he began dealing the cards wordlessly , with such force and rapidity that they soon overspilled the table .
trick , as it were , over .
a â€œ second deal â€ â€” a maneuver , often referred to simply as a â€œ second â€ in the world of card magic â€” is when the magician appears to deal from the top of a deck but is in fact dealing the card .
â€œ 184 seconds â€ was anticlimactic by design , privileging invisible technique while eliminating any perceptible effect â€” all hat , in other words , and no rabbit .
â€œ there â€™ s something beautiful about that , â€ delgaudio told me , â€œ and there â€™ s something heartbreaking .
â€ they also include illusionists like penn teller and david blaine , who met delgaudio a decade ago .
â€œ i â€™ d heard about this young genius everyone was buzzing about , and we finally met , in a diner , i think , â€ blaine recalled .
â€ in seeking to bridge the disciplines of magic and fine art , delgaudio has performed at both the magic castle ( the exclusive conjurers â€™ club in los angeles ) and the kitchen ( the venue in manhattan ) .
all were politely cagey : staff members were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements before joining the production .
a final dress rehearsal was to start shortly .
â€ ( i will describe â€œ in of itself â€ in detail .
oz apologized to delgaudio for the distraction .
also close at hand was gil cates jr. the geffen â€™ s executive director , who told me that the playhouse slotted â€œ in of itself â€ into its 2016 season before delgaudio could really even describe it .
that show generated lines in an initial run at the magic castle and drew notable attendees : ricky jay and penn teller , rick rubin , ryan gosling and eva mendes .
in that show , delgaudio â€™ s conceptualist leanings were on playful display .
.
.. â€ guimarÃ£es began , narrating .
â€œ it was a fine trick , â€ delgaudio told me , but it wasn â€™ t done .
next , delgaudio stood and performed it a second time .
â€œ this card has the potential .
.
a different card was picked â€” and discovered beneath the same glass .
â€œ every beat was exactly the same , â€ delgaudio recalled .
â€œ all the dialogue was the same .
but the ultimate effect wasn â€™ t , because they â€™ d just heard it and seen it .
today delgaudio looks back on â€œ nothing to hide â€ with qualified enthusiasm .
this question hung in my mind as the dress rehearsal began .
we filed into the darkened theater , where seats were arranged on risers .
the significance of these dioramas emerged and shifted during the show , sometimes through magical effects and sometimes simply though stories delgaudio told , to the accompaniment of an original score by mark mothersbaugh .
then , with unwavering eye contact , he addressed us individually by our chosen descriptors , even though he had not once seen our cards .
this moment tottered right on the edge of hokey , calling to mind hucksterish traditions of mentalism .
and yet , there was also something genuinely unnerving about being identified in this way .
watching a trick to completion , we are not rescued from unreality but rather are marooned in it .
delgaudio also aimed , in the show , to bare himself to us .
during an autobiographical passage , he recounted the night he discovered , at the age of 6 , that his mother , who had been raising him on her own , was gay .
â€ when the story was over , delgaudio dislodged the brick from the window and dropped it with a thud .
the cards tumbled gorgeously into the void left behind .
the monologue , he assured me later , was â€œ for the first time in a magic show an honest origin story .
â€ he went on : â€œ you don â€™ t become a magician because â€˜ my grandfather bought me a magic kit. â€™ it â€™ s because your parents fought and told you you were worthless .
it â€™ s because you were in circumstances so bad you needed to escape .
the floor was covered with pads he was housebreaking his new puppy , chaplin .
our conversation returned to the brick .
â€œ i don â€™ t know how they â€™ ll react when they see it .
but i like the idea that the show doesn â€™ t stop when the lights go up .
â€ he plopped down on a cot , yanking off his shoes .
â€ delgaudio owes his career to a tiny shop called zeezo â€™ s , in colorado springs .
when he was 12 , he went in , intending to buy a practical joke .
his favorite entertainers were physical dynamos of classic hollywood , like chaplin , keaton and gene kelly .
but â€œ expert at the card table â€ pulled back the curtain on a discipline defined by virtuoso physicality of a sneakier sort .
delgaudio suspects that the clerks sold him the erdnase with low expectations : it â€™ s advanced reading for a kid .
â€ by ninth grade , delgaudio was capable not only of exquisite second deals but also of significantly more difficult â€œ center deals , â€ in which the dealt card comes from the middle of a deck .
his fixation alienated him from his peers .
bullies took to â€œ throwing pencils at me , â€ he recalled , adding : â€œ it was rare to find someone at school i connected with .
i wanted to go hang out at a bar and see a guy deal off the bottom of the deck .
â€œ like , â€˜ this is the life you want ?
â€œ i have friends who do that .
( this milieu provided the backdrop for a pitch for a show that delgaudio sold a few years ago to hbo . )
â€ delgaudio nodded respectfully .
â€ after the first l. a. preview of â€œ in of itself , â€ delgaudio , frank oz and amy levinson â€” the geffen â€™ s resident dramaturge , whose job is something like a sympathetic critic â€” gathered for a meeting .
the big note for delgaudio was that the show did not yet feel fully coherent .
â€ delgaudio frowned thoughtfully , sitting on the floor .
â€ delgaudio â€™ s aversion to accessibility can be extreme .
he told me that he sometimes bristles at the sound of applause .
so i decided i â€™ d just rather not be famous .
among the images was a rendition of the diorama .
through teamwork , they eventually discover the truth .
â€œ what if that thing was some sort of magical creature that had a snake for a nose and legs , and they convinced it it was an elephant ?
maybe that â€™ s why you don â€™ t see those things anymore .
i â€™ ll have them imagine a person they know .
imagine it â€™ s true .
this will happen every night , and it â€™ s impossible .
â€ most crowd participation at a magic show is fake , a pantomime of audience agency that leaves the magician in full control .
sometimes this meant tears ( â€œ it â€™ s from my mother !
i want to show people something amazing that â€™ s true .

â€ the $ 1 .
â€œ we â€™ re not spending money on that anymore , â€ mr. mulvaney told reporters at the white house .
military spending would increase by $ 54 billion , a 10 percent rise , in 2018 , in addition to a $ 30 billion increase in the current year .
for mr. trump , the complaints from nearly all quarters may serve to amplify his image as an outsider who is not beholden to the special interests in washington .
â€ he did not address any of the proposed cuts .
senator mike lee , republican of utah , called mr. trump â€™ s budget proposal â€œ a solid step toward addressing the gross overspending that is driving our national debt .
â€ ''
still , the extent of the cuts in the proposed budget unveiled early thursday shocked scientists , researchers and program administrators .
8 billion , or 18 percent , from the national institutes of health , which fund thousands of researchers working on cancer and other diseases , and $ 900 million , or a little less than 20 percent , from the department of energy â€™ s office of science , which funds the national laboratories , considered among the crown jewels of basic research in the world .
the white house is also proposing to eliminate climate science programs throughout the federal government , including at the environmental protection agency .
â€œ the record of scientific research is so good , for so many years â€” who would want to sell it short ?
â€ some cuts were singled out for criticism .
judith enck , a regional e. p. a. official in the obama administration and now a visiting scholar at pace university school of law , called the proposed science cuts in her former agency â€œ nonsensical .
nasa â€™ s budget would be cut only slightly , by less than 1 percent , but the white house is proposing a shift in where the money would be spent â€” eliminating four earth science missions and the $ 115 million the agency is spending on education .
its annual appropriation of about $ 300 million would be eliminated .
it â€™ s almost surreal .
â€ ''
he does propose increasing military spending by 10 percent , something many conservatives would also like to see , but he probably can not unilaterally break through legal budget caps , imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government â€™ s statutory borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling .
it is precisely what conservatives have wanted to control .
â€œ that is not a legacy i want to leave .
â€œ i would just suggest to you it â€™ s not the right time for the question .
the budget blueprint , again , does not deal with the debt .
it even doesn â€™ t even deal with the deficit .
the congressional budget office foresees a federal deficit for the 2018 fiscal year of $ 487 billion , rising steadily from there until it reaches $ 1 trillion in 2023 .
â€œ we can â€™ t finance a defense buildup entirely on the back of domestic , nondefense spending .
it â€™ s not realistic and unfair .
â€ mr. trump â€™ s budget also shows little regard for the political sensitivities of his party .
mr. mcconnell on thursday went in search of a silver lining .
â€œ these are positive steps in the right direction .
i look forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring .
â€™ â€ he left without complaint .
â€œ you can be a worthy adversary and not be an enemy .
â€ but even then mr. mulvaney â€™ s ambition was apparent .
by then a father of triplets , he was elected in 2006 to the state house of representatives , where he gained a reputation as a budding fiscal hawk and policy maven .
â€œ during his career both in the legislature and in congress he was very consistent in that regard .
â€œ that â€™ s a little bit of a departure for him .
â€ this is , after all , the same man who once gathered in a capitol hill chapel with three fellow conservative freshmen members from south carolina in 2011 , seeking spiritual guidance as the government was hours away from shutting down .

his first attempt to sharply limit travel from a handful of predominantly muslim countries ended in a courtroom fiasco last month , when a federal court in seattle halted it .
mr. trump issued a new and narrower travel ban , affecting six countries , on march 6 , trying to satisfy the courts by removing some of the most contentious elements of the original version .
his decision cited mr. trump â€™ s public comments to conclude that there were â€œ strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban , â€ and that mr. trump may have intended to violate the constitutional prohibition on religious preferences .
mr. trump also removed iraq from the list of countries covered by the ban after the pentagon expressed worry that it would damage the united states â€™ relationship with the iraqi government in the fight against the islamic state .

1831,19329 , trump may have pushed dutch voters away from populism - the new york times , new york times , alissa j. rubin,2017-03-17,2017.0,3.0 , , '' the hague â€” if there is one thing the dutch agree on , it is to preserve the dikes that protect this country from the ravages of violent seas .
that sentiment translates into politics .
for the dutch , both the british vote to leave the european union and donald j. trump â€™ s election in the united states broke political dikes , leaving the dutch ill at ease with the conflict and uncertainty that has ensued .
they have already blown in britain , where the incautious choice of a referendum on europe removed the usual electoral safeguards , and in the united states , where the electoral college has twice overridden the popular vote since 2000 .
so while the sense of relief among politicians and voters was palpable on thursday after the dutch vote , europe â€” its project of integration , its unity , its political ideals â€” was by no means free of populist threats .
over all , parties , including the parties defined as populist by academics and pollsters , gained seven seats in the dutch parliament , giving them 57 percent of the body in this election , in contrast to 52 .
6 percent in the last election when they had 79 seats .
similarly , the british vote to leave the european union , known as brexit , may look less inviting as a model as the reality of its messiness comes into view .
â€ â€œ at the same time , â€ he added , â€œ we have seen a drop in populism in europe since brexit , as citizens have realized that , while a protest vote is fun , it can lead to the uncertainties of brexit , which are not funny at all .
not everyone agrees , and some analysts underscored that all politics are local .
â€œ it â€™ s not just that the netherlands was not that concerned with trump and brexit , it â€™ s that there â€™ s a provincialism about these european elections , â€ said e. c. hendriks , a dutch researcher in social sciences and cultural anthropology who is now at peking university in beijing .

the disclosures were unusual prosecutors rarely announce the conclusion of such inquiries when no charges are filed .

the family lived in doocastle , county mayo , in a small cottage on a hill outside a village called tubbercurry , in county sligo .
that included the notorious british â€œ black and tans â€ paramilitary group , which waged a night of terror in tubbercurry in october 1920 , burning buildings , including church parish halls , according to michael farry , an irish historian who has documented the war in sligo .
in december 1921 , britain and ireland signed a peace treaty , only to have civil war break out six months later among the irish .
then , according to a handwritten ledger from irish military archives , mr. cawley enlisted in the irish free state â€™ s army .
in the united states , and sentiment was flaring .
and it might have been easier to gain entry to the united states with a british address , said richard white , a stanford historian who has chronicled his own grandfather â€™ s illegal immigration from ireland to chicago in 1924 .
he had the equivalent of $ 23 .
in 1927 , he was hired as a motorman for the chicago surface lines , a streetcar service later absorbed by the chicago transit authority , which still has mr. cawley â€™ s insurance card on file .
by 1931 , records show , he had married mary elizabeth maloney , a teacher and american whose family hailed from doonbeg , county clare .
( in 2014 , mr. trump bought a golf course there . )
with mrs. cawley â€™ s widowed mother , they moved into a tidy brick â€œ â€ â€” tenants , often relatives , rented the second floor â€” on the south side .
( his father died in 1988 , and his mother remarried . )
mr. cawley was 56 when mr. pence was born .
â€ holidays meant trips to chicago .
by this time , his grandparents were retired and traveled frequently to ireland .
â€ yet he also took tough stances , pleasing the right .
as governor , he barred syrian refugees from indiana , citing fear of terrorism .
in 2013 , mr. pence took his wife , karen , and their three children on vacation to ireland , stopping in doonbeg , where hugh mcnally , a distant cousin , runs a bar .

i don â€™ t want that to be eliminated .
if they succeed in undoing the affordable care act , it would add momentum to efforts to enact other items on their agenda , such as tax cuts and a rewrite of the tax code .
but they are in a delicate dance with conservatives and moderates .
but the vote in the budget committee portends possible difficulties .
three conservative republicans â€” dave brat of virginia , gary palmer of alabama and mark sanford of south carolina â€” voted no , joining a united democratic opposition .
â€œ it dismantles obamacare â€™ s mandates and taxes .
it puts health care decisions back in the hands of patients and doctors .
beyond the faster end to the medicaid expansion and work requirements for some medicaid beneficiaries , some conservatives are still pressing to limit the size of the tax credit for the purchase of insurance to no more than the amount of federal income taxes a recipient owes .
â€ some 20 million uninsured people have gained coverage under the law , which was signed by mr. obama seven years ago .
it is not a health care bill .
they can no longer afford it .

1835,19335 , fed raises interest rates for third time since financial crisis - the new york times , new york times , binyamin appelbaum,2017-03-16,2017.0,3.0 , , '' the federal reserve , which raised its benchmark rate on wednesday for the second time in three months , this time to a range between 0 .
but it certainly was not ebullient .
â€œ the real test will be whether the economy can withstand positive real rates .
the fed â€™ s committee next meets on may 2 and 3 .
she noted that the fed â€™ s outlook is less clear .
the unemployment rate fell to 4 .
the fed â€™ s preferred measure rose 1 .
â€œ and it â€™ s been doing nicely .
ms. yellen took the opportunity to note that inflation may now rise a bit above 2 percent , just as it has been below 2 percent the last few years .
this time the fed waited just three months .
banks tend to raise interest rates on loans more quickly than they raise rates on deposits .
last week , the average rate on a certificate of deposit was 0 .
last year at this time : 0 .
some economists and liberal activists argue that the fed is raising rates too quickly .
6 percent in 2016 , and there is little sign of an acceleration during the first quarter .
perhaps less expected : so has the art in it .
organized by christopher y. lew , the whitney â€™ s associate curator , and mia locks , an independent curator , it has some immature inclusions and other letdowns .
take henry taylor â€™ s gripping history painting of philando castile dying in the passenger seat of his car in a st. paul suburb , having just been shot by a policeman whose gun , arm and uniform are visible through the car window .
we are inside the car , in the driver â€™ s seat , bearing witness with diamond reynolds , mr. castile â€™ s girlfriend , as she his mortal injury on a cellphone .
his shirt is spattered with paint , not blood .
mr. taylor â€™ s style is harsh but it doesn â€™ t overplay .
this presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 biennial , a raucous , untidy show unforgettable for the issues it threw in viewers â€™ faces â€” and for often overly didactic , hectoring and visually dry art .
the current biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers .
the show is promising from the start , in the lobby , which is festooned with 10 opulently embroidered and appliquÃ©d banners by cauleen smith , a chicago artist whose work is also in the film program .
on the fifth floor , dana schutz â€™ s â€œ elevator , â€ commissioned by the museum , is a weak , scattered reprise of a smaller , better painting in her last gallery show .
on the sixth floor , the opener is mr. taylor â€™ s ambitious â€œ ancestors of ghenghis khan with black man on horse , â€ a canvas .
it lacks the clarity of the philando castile painting ( whose furious title is â€œ the times thay aint a changing , fast enough !
â€ ) or â€œ the 4th , â€ a canvas of a black man at a backyard grill that has the heft of an official royal portrait from centuries past .
like mr. taylor , ms. lawson addresses the dangers , contradictions and cultural richness of living in america as a black person .
â€œ a very long line â€ â€” a video installation by the collective postcommodity involving blurry images of tall fences shot from a moving car â€” takes over the walls of a small gallery , capturing the viewer in a noisily rattling cage .
â€œ real violence â€ finds an apt foil in the discombobulated sculptures of kaari upson in the same gallery : urethane casts of severely damaged couches shades of red , silver and pink that suggest bodies at once powerful and pathetic .
impressively , the show â€™ s Ã©minence grises are showing some of the best work of their careers .
the weird symbolism in jo baer â€™ s paintings fuse the grays of her early minimalist abstractions with visions of irish myths and monuments .

on thursday , the french brand named clare waight keller as its artistic director , responsible for women â€™ s and men â€™ s wear , accessories and couture .
ms. had been creative director of women â€™ s at louis vuitton , a brand that , like givenchy , is owned by lvmh moÃ«t hennessy louis vuitton .
by contrast , there is nothing about ms. waight keller , 46 , a personality often pictured peeking out from under her long brown hair , hands tucked into trouser pockets .
as a designer , she has seemed content to let her brands be the stars , and her work , both at chloÃ© and in her former position as designer of pringle of scotland , was marked by a accessible elegance with a tailored line .
think of it as slouchy chic .
â€ though ms. waight keller , who began her career working at calvin klein in new york and with tom ford at gucci , was also in charge of men â€™ s wear at pringle , she has never worked with an haute couture atelier before .
it also suggests that the idea was false that ms. waight keller , who has three children and has recently moved her family to london from paris , was taking time off after chloÃ© because of the pressures of today â€™ s fashion cycle .
6 billion in 2016 , an increase of 5 percent , beating expectations because of strong sales in the united states and europe , and a pickup in demand in asia .
( in june , christian dior , the structural owner of lvmh , named maria grazia chiuri as artistic director . )
it may seem astonishing , but the idea that a designer would not have to choose between having a power position and a family life is a relatively new look in the fashion world .
ms. waight keller officially begins work may 2 .
her first show for givenchy will take place during paris fashion week in october .
the fashion world will be left to speculate on where mr. tisci , whose next move has not yet been announced , will end up .
rumor has it the answer is versace .

1839,19340 , so you think you can â€™ t meditate ?
or at least they talked about the desire to meditate .
â€œ mindfulness , â€ we â€™ re calling it , this desire to take a chunk of each day and simply live in the present .
left on my own , meditation time turns into nap time , so i knew i needed some organization and supervision .
i chose mndfl , which has locations in greenwich village , on the upper east side and in williamsburg , brooklyn .
sound baths are like listening to a concert while in savasana , the resting pose at the end of yoga .
watch : the author sits for a sound bath at mndfl .

she instructed us to bring ourselves back to the room whenever our minds wandered .

the physical toll from living in uncertainty .

but this time , i knew better than to feel ready for something so unpredictable .
the first time , our foster son left our home after 11 months to live with extended biological family members .
this time , we think , will be different .
this time , reunification with biological family isn â€™ t an option .
this time , with this boy , adoption isn â€™ t just a possibility but a probability .
i wasn â€™ t sure until the moment he turned toward me and met my eyes for just a second before looking back down toward the ground .
nice to meet us .
it was in that moment that i realized what had really been holding me back .
this sweet kid whose hugs are more like tight squeezes .
yes , i can do this again .
â€œ we can take it all down if you want , â€ i tell him .
â€œ we can start fresh .
â€œ and that , and probably that , too .
â€ he is polite in his dismantling of the room .
he is deliberate in his word choice and careful with my feelings .
the first thing he keeps is a framed , picture of a bird , which i hung in honor of our former foster son , whom we nicknamed bluejay .
he doesn â€™ t understand its significance he just likes it .
the second thing he keeps is something i hung long before we were even licensed .
we don â€™ t read the words aloud , we keep them inside our own heads : â€œ oh , the places you â€™ ll go .

mr. tillerson â€™ s comments in seoul , a day before he travels to beijing to meet chinese leaders , explicitly rejected any return to the bargaining table in an effort to buy time by halting north korea â€™ s accelerating testing program .
â€œ only then will we be prepared to engage them in talks .
his inconsistency of tone may have been intended to signal a tougher line to the chinese before he lands in beijing on saturday .
â€œ i see very little prospect of a collapse , â€ he added .
as a consequence , their policies were not very effective .
the site â€™ s reporters have never traveled with the secretary before .

two other republican senators , susan collins of maine and shelley moore capito of west virginia , signed their names last month to a letter urging continued support for the endowments , which together get $ 300 million a year .

â€ ( the corporation sent $ 11 .
8 million to radio and television stations in ohio $ 1 .
6 million to stations in west virginia and $ 9 .
1 million to stations in michigan in 2014 , the last year for which a breakdown was available on its website . )
â€ even some opponents of the endowments concede that they have a fight on their hands .
â€ ''
as some lawmakers came out for the measure , some others â€” in the house and senate â€” were stepping forward to oppose it .
if , instead , states accepted payments , they could gain more control over spending and more freedom to administer the program and define eligibility and benefits .
another republican senator , joni ernst of iowa , was noncommittal .
mr. palmer voted against the house bill in the budget committee on thursday .
changing the bill to win over such conservatives risks alienating more moderate members of the house and the senate who worry that the measure could cause millions of people to lose health coverage .
house republican moderates may be loath to take a difficult political vote if they are convinced the measure will die in the senate .
â€ the house democratic whip , representative steny h. hoyer of maryland , predicted that while the bill might be approved by the house , â€œ it will not become law .
â€ under the affordable care act , 31 states have expanded medicaid , providing coverage to millions of adults .
â€œ it â€™ s our bill .

hours after the release of a damaging analysis on the health bill from the congressional budget office , the site published leaked audio of mr. ryan telling house members last october that he could no longer defend mr. trump â€™ s campaign .
but to admirers of mr. ryan , the message of the leak was unsubtle .

while the coalition has been preparing for an assault on raqqa , the de facto capital of the islamic state , it has been waging a parallel series of airstrikes against al qaeda , virtually all of which have occurred in idlib province . ''
in a separate episode , officials also reported friday that a secret service laptop was stolen from an agency vehicle in brooklyn .
i have an appointment , â€ according to a court filing .
representative jason chaffetz , republican of utah and the chairman of the house committee on oversight and government reform , wrote in a letter on friday to the secret service that the committee received â€œ additional information â€ about the episode , including indications that mr. tran â€œ may have moved around on the white house grounds undetected for a considerable amount of time .
mr. chaffetz also said that the committee had received information indicating that the secret service â€œ ignored â€ alarms that mr. tran tripped and that he may have attempted to get into the white house itself .
â€œ if true , these allegations raise questions about whether the agency â€™ s security protocols are adequate , â€ mr. chaffetz said , stressing â€œ longstanding concerns â€ about security episodes at facilities protected by the secret service .
last week â€™ s recalled an embarrassing episode for the secret service in september 2014 , when an intruder with a knife , omar j. gonzalez , managed to run through the ceremonial east room of the white house before he was apprehended .
a 2015 report by the house oversight committee called the secret service â€œ an agency in crisis â€ and found that over a period , there had been 143 security breaches and attempted security breaches at secured facilities . ''
they are also feeding information back to marine corps investigators .
but the commandant of the marine corps , gen. robert b. neller , frankly admitted to the senate armed services committee on tuesday that the scandal was a cultural problem he was to address .
â€œ we had to show them it was just metastasizing into other back rooms .
â€œ the marine corps can â€™ t do this alone .
â€œ we need to police ourselves .
â€œ and when we forced them to , they were caught off guard .
earlier this week , representative jackie speier , democrat of california , announced that investigators had identified 700 marines and 150 marines in the reserve who were involved in the marines united group .
when women complained , the site â€™ s followers often harassed them more .
with $ 10 , 000 of his own money , he bought targeted ads on facebook on monday to appear on the pages of young marines , especially young female marines .

while the israeli aircraft may have escaped unscathed , the sirens and explosions served to thrust israel â€™ s yearslong shadow war in syria uncomfortably into the limelight .
israel has repeatedly declared its neutrality in the struggle between mr. assad of syria and rebel forces .

throughout the winter the inuit hunt seal and caribou , and they fish through the ice for arctic char .
the sound of trickling water fills the humid , air .
on my recent trip it was 20 degrees below zero ( minus 29 degrees celsius ) but a balmy 32 degrees fahrenheit ( 0 degrees celsius ) beneath the ice .
the ground was covered with kelp , the occasional crab and edible clumps of roe from the fourhorn sculpin , which the inuit call the ugly fish .

â€ as a poet , mr. walcott plumbed the paradoxes of identity intrinsic to his situation .
he was a poet living on a island whose people spoke creole or english .
his father , warwick , a schoolteacher and watercolorist , died when he was an infant , and he was raised by his schoolteacher mother , the former alix maarlin .
his education was anglocentric and thoroughly traditional .
â€ â€œ forget the snow and daffodils .
they were real , more real than the heat and oleander , perhaps , because they lived on the page , in imagination , and therefore in memory .
his early models were marlowe and milton .
with each succeeding collection â€” â€œ selected poems â€ ( 1964 ) â€œ the castaway â€ ( 1969 ) â€œ the gulf â€ ( 1970 ) and â€œ sea grapes â€ ( 1976 ) â€” mr. walcott established himself as something more than an interesting local poet .
the artistic of â€œ another life , â€ with its rich , intertwining of the artist â€™ s developing sensibility and the lush landscape of st. lucia , set the bar for mr. walcott â€™ s later , increasingly ambitious poetry .
â€ travel and exile were constants in mr. walcott â€™ s poetry .
like his father , mr. walcott was an accomplished watercolorist his landscape paintings appear on his book jackets , and in â€œ tiepolo â€™ s hound â€ they are interspersed through the book .

his candidacy was derailed when academics at oxford received an anonymous package containing photocopied pages of a book describing allegations of sexual harassment brought by a harvard student decades earlier .
he added , â€œ while i was happy to be put forward for the post , if it has degenerated into a low and degrading attempt at character assassination , i do not want to be part of it .
this peculiar position , he argued , had its advantages .

1856,19359 , why are basketball games so squeaky ?
squeaks are the background rhythm to the game .

it is why a finger sings on the rim of a wine glass or screeches on the outside of an inflated balloon .
and that â€™ s the same thing for a spiny lobster .
â€ steve kerr , the warriors â€™ coach , said the atmosphere was â€œ weird , â€ and a player , draymond green , called it â€œ pathetic .

a. men â€™ s and women â€™ s basketball tournaments .
perhaps unrealized at home , there are stretches when squeaking shoes and the occasional barking of coaches comprise most of the noise in the arena .
even fewer have researched the topic .
those vibrations become sound â€” quick , squeaks .
to fans , they are noise .
to players , they are necessities .
â€œ the squeak is reassurance to a lot of players .
they listen for it .
â€ the squeak means that they are not just sticking , but sliding .
they agree that at the core of a basketball shoe â€™ s squeak is the phenomenon â€” the same principle studied by engineers for its clattering effect on machinery and by seismologists for the way tectonic plates stick and slip to cause earthquakes .

the democrats now feel emboldened to try anything .

republicans hold 52 seats in the senate , and they say they are committed to confirming judge gorsuch even if that requires revisions to rules requiring a majority .

the other was judge garland , who had waited 18 months before his confirmation to the d. c. circuit .
in january , just after mr. trump announced his nomination , judge gorsuch called judge garland .
others called it empty and calculated political theater .
given republican control of the senate , judge gorsuch is likely to be confirmed , though perhaps only after a momentous revision to senate practices to eliminate the filibuster against supreme court nominees .

i did the whole national tour ( in australia ) â€” about 14 months â€” and every night i was crying at the part where she sings , â€œ i â€™ d give my life for you , â€ and crying at the part where the refugees are climbing up the walls , because i was also a refugee , from vietnam to australia .

laurence connor ( revival director ) my memory of the original is it felt so big and epic and operatic .
it was so heartbreaking .
i didn â€™ t know what happened until i read the script when i was cast .
i was like , â€œ oh my goodness , this is epic .

older workers may feel they â€™ ve lost their shot at running the show , and younger workers may feel their older subordinates just can â€™ t wait for them to mess up , said david stillman , an author of the new book â€œ gen z @ work .
younger bosses may think that , yeah , the older worker is kind of a dinosaur .
â€œ i â€™ m willing to admit that .
and not every older worker feels marginalized or unappreciated , nor does every younger boss feel disdainful and misunderstood .
it â€™ s very collaborative .
they also avoid petty drama , because this isn â€™ t their first time at the rodeo .

drowsy driving kills .
when drowsiness is detected , drivers are typically warned with a sound and the appearance of a coffee cup icon .
to find out if drowsiness can be detected even earlier , plessey semiconductors has developed sensors , to be placed in a seat , that monitor changes in heart rate .
until vehicles can drive themselves , it will be up to drivers to pull over once they feel drowsy .
when its traffic jam pilot feature is engaged , the vehicle will need to determine if a driver is alert enough to take control after being a passive passenger for long periods .
drowsy driving can only be and not measured like drunkenness .
also , drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking .
â€œ we â€™ re a nation of tired drivers .
â€œ as a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous .
that leeway carries its own perils .
that is also likely to be the case in the impending battle to reclaim raqqa in eastern syria .

all they cared about was keeping anyone off the supreme court who might vote to reverse roe or water it down .
â€ chief justice rehnquist , who died in 2005 , took much the same approach at his 1986 confirmation hearing to become chief justice .
what neither senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california , nor senator charles e. grassley , republican of iowa , has is a law degree .

ms. feinstein â€™ s particular place among senior female senators can be viewed at times through the prism of the issues she champions .
during a debate over language concerning abortion in a 2015 human trafficking bill , ms. feinstein took to the senate floor to extemporaneously and passionately explain her position .
â€ her position can also be seen when she feels the sting of condescension .
in 2013 , during a hearing on gun control , she famously sparred with senator ted cruz , republican of texas , as he lectured her about the constitution .
â€œ i â€™ m not a sixth grader , senator , â€ she told mr. cruz , then a senate newcomer .
â€ she added , â€œ she is now the senior woman senator , and she takes that very seriously .
â€ he added , â€œ i â€™ d probably feel more comfortable if i were a lawyer , but i am telling you , as a farmer , i feel comfortable .

1889,19398 , '' offices of volkswagen and audi chiefs searched in raid , warrant says - the new york times '' , new york times , jack ewing,2017-03-20,2017.0,3.0 , , '' frankfurt â€” german officials included the offices of both volkswagen â€™ s chief executive and the head of the audi division when they raided company premises last week as part of an investigation into emissions fraud , according to a copy of the search warrant .
it does not identify matthias mÃ¼ller , volkswagen â€™ s chief executive , or rupert stadler , head of the audi luxury car division , as suspects in the case .
investigators do not yet have enough evidence to determine who is responsible for illegally manipulating diesel motor software to deceive american regulators , according to the warrant .
but the warrant , signed by a judge in munich , allowed investigators to seize documents and other items such as appointment calendars , copies of emails , mobile phones and electronic passwords from mr. mÃ¼ller and mr. stadler , and numerous other current or past volkswagen and audi employees .
the document portrays a much broader investigation than was previously known .
the document , which also included a map of audi headquarters in ingolstadt , germany , names 47 people whose property is subject to seizure , including mr. mÃ¼ller and mr. stadler .
volkswagen has had to continually retreat from its initial assertion in 2015 that the deception was the work of a handful of rogue engineers .
volkswagen pleaded guilty in a detroit court this month to charges that included conspiracy to violate the clean air act .
in a statement of facts , volkswagen said that its employees programmed pollution control equipment in diesel cars to operate at a reduced level except when software detected that an emissions test was underway .
volkswagen also conceded that , when it became clear that united states regulators were about to uncover the fraud , lawyers encouraged other employees to destroy evidence .
the munich investigation had attracted only modest attention until wednesday , when officials appeared at audi headquarters early in the morning with the search warrant and began taking possession of documents .
he became chief executive of volkswagen in september 2015 after mr. winterkorn resigned in the aftermath of the scandal .
audi has agreed to pay $ 1 .
2 billion to settle a consumer fraud lawsuit by the federal trade commission involving about 80 , 000 vehicles with diesel motors .
that is part of more than $ 22 billion that volkswagen is paying in settlements and fines .
the deception at audi originated in 2005 when the division first decided to begin marketing cars with diesel motors in the united states , according to the warrant .
but audi engineers soon realized that the holding tanks in the cars could not hold enough of the urea fluid to last between regular service intervals , while still meeting the united states â€™ stricter limits on nitrogen oxides .

decades later , after mr. breslin had become famous , his father , destitute in miami , came back into his life â€œ like heavy snow through a broken window , â€ he wrote .

on songs like â€œ brown eyed handsome man , â€ he sang , in judiciously coded language , about pushing back against segregation .
white artists had been studying him , and were building up a version of rock â€™ n â€™ roll that no longer required mr. berry , nor his blackness .
he was obstinate about his influence .
even when he was being celebrated , mr. berry grated .

he was 90 .
the st. charles county police department confirmed his death on its facebook page .
and tucked into the lighthearted , telegraphic narratives that he sang with such clear enunciation was a sly defiance , upending convention to claim the pleasures of the moment .
in â€œ sweet little sixteen , â€ â€œ you can â€™ t catch me â€ and other songs , mr. berry invented rock as a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times ( even with cops in pursuit ) .
his rock â€™ n â€™ roll was a music of joyful lusts , tensions and gleefully shattered icons .
he received a degree in hairdressing and cosmetology and worked for a time as a beautician he married themetta suggs in 1948 and started a family .
he also recognized the popularity of country music and added some hillbilly twang to his guitar lines .
waters directed him to the label he recorded for , chess records , where one of the owners , leonard chess , heard potential in mr. berry â€™ s song â€œ ida red .

no matter how calculated songs like â€œ school day â€ or â€œ rock and roll music â€ may have been , they reached the top 10 , caught the early rock â€™ n â€™ roll spirit and detailed its mythology .

he was tried twice and found guilty both times the first verdict was overturned because of racist remarks by the judge .
when he emerged from 20 months in prison in 1964 , his wife had left him ( they later reconciled ) and his songwriting spark had diminished .
while he toured steadily through the 1960s , headlining or sharing bills with bands that grew up on his songs , his recording career stalled after he moved from chess to mercury records in 1966 .

â€œ he â€™ s not pessimistic , â€ said rich barton , the founder of the real estate site zillow , which mr. gurley also invested in .
â€œ he â€™ s simply ahead .
â€ in 1999 , mr. gurley joined benchmark capital , as the venture firm was known at the time .
benchmark was then on a hot streak , having initially invested $ 5 million in ebay in 1997 and reaped a more than 50 , 000 percent return after the online auction marketplace went public in 1998 .
the firm underwent a rougher stretch during the bust in the early 2000s .

â€ that outspokenness has not meant mr. gurley is always right .
when the jet .

com sold to walmart for more than $ 3 .
3 billion , netting a big payday for investors .
com .
at the time , mr. gurley put $ 12 million into the company , which was then valued at $ 60 million .
today , uber is valued at close to $ 70 billion â€” about 1 , 100 times as valuable as it was when benchmark invested â€” and has become the world â€™ s most valuable privately held tech .
that has left mr. gurley with few levers he can pull for influence , though he is known for his deft touch with big personalities .
mr. gurley â€™ s thinking has occasionally held sway at uber .
last year , with its spending in china showing few signs of abating , many investors agreed that such losses would squash any hopes of a public offering , according to four people who participated in those conversations mr. gurley held an informal meeting with jean liu , the president of didi , in according to a person briefed on the .
shortly thereafter , mr. kalanick , partly at the urging of mr. gurley , agreed to sell uber â€™ s china business to didi , with uber taking a stake in the resulting entity .
it was a win for investors .

the state of coral reefs is a telling sign of the health of the seas .
in poorer countries , lives are at stake : hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish , and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis .
â€ corals require warm water to thrive , but they are exquisitely sensitive to extra heat .
globally , the ocean has warmed by about 1 .
an additional kick was supplied by an el niÃ±o weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet , causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880 .
australia relies on the great barrier reef for about 70 , 000 jobs and billions of dollars annually in tourism revenue , and it is not yet clear how that economy will be affected by the reef â€™ s deterioration .
the corals may save themselves , as many other creatures are attempting to do , by moving toward the poles as the earth warms , establishing new reefs in cooler water .
the corals themselves are tiny polyps that act like farmers , capturing colorful plants called algae that convert sunlight into food .
if water temperatures drop soon enough , the corals can grow new algae and survive , but if not , they may succumb to starvation or disease .
even when the corals die , some reefs eventually recover .
if water temperatures stay moderate , the damaged sections of the great barrier reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years .
if they become routine , many of the world â€™ s coral reefs may never be able to themselves .
even though last year â€™ s el niÃ±o has ended , water temperatures are high enough that his maps are showing continued hot water across millions of square miles of the ocean .

1908,19428 , is gascony the most delicious corner of france ?
also check out the food section â€™ s guide to french cooking and our survey of five classic specialties , from bouillabaisse to galettes .
look closely at a map of southwestern france and you â€™ ll notice it : a blank spot just west of toulouse where the place names thin out and the train lines and expressways veer away , like a stream flowing around a boulder .
for gascon food is richer than the sunny cuisine of provence .
it is unabashedly , defiantly rich .
duck fat , not olive oil , is the local currency .
it would eventually start to rain .
and if you hop in the car , the traffic will disappear and you will find yourself in a decidedly landscape : undulating fields of corn and rapeseed , vineyard parcels intercut with lush grazing pastures , hedgerows of broom and honeysuckle , tidy groves of oak and hemlock , villages and , around almost every curve , signs advertising foie gras and duck confit .
gascony is not merely distinct from provence and the cÃ´te d â€™ azur .
gascony is more open , more soulful , more deeply french , and , in its devotion to tradition , more pleasurably frozen in time .
its cuisine is arguably less sophisticated than provence â€™ s , and yet it is more firmly rooted in the land it sprang from , and it is , i put to you , enjoyed with lustier abandon .
only 840 , 000 tourists visited the dÃ©partement in 2015 .
( by comparison , a staggering 11 million visited the which includes nice and cannes . )
though the gers is not france â€™ s most sparsely populated district , it is the most agricultural , with more of its land under cultivation than that of any other french district .
humans in the gers are vastly outnumbered by livestock , especially ducks .
also â€” interesting fact â€” the humans who do live there live a long time .
both those facts tend to be met with incredulity by visitors encountering gascon cooking for the first time .
the wine to drink with this fare , indisputably , is madiran .

arrayed along the choir â€™ s perimeter are 113 thronelike â€œ stalles â€ of intricately carved oak .
comprising thousands of painstakingly rendered figures and scenes depicting the life of jesus and other biblical episodes , some of them in gruesome detail , the stalles constitute the most feat of woodworking craftsmanship i have ever seen .
the route also encompasses the popular medieval bastion of larressingle and the imposing cloister at la romieu , as well as the prosperous village of montrÃ©al du gers , where , at an inviting restaurant called l â€™ escale , you can have a swank al fresco meal of roasted capon in a foie gras and morel sauce while seated beneath the graceful arcades of the town square .
those destinations are certainly worthy ones , particularly on a weekday between october and may , when you will have a decent chance of having them nearly all to yourself .
this is , unequivocally , my favorite bar in france .
the slightly establishment is festooned with rugby ephemera â€” the sport being as sacred to gascons as duck fat â€” and is furnished with a long wood bar , a couple of rickety barstools , and , teetering slightly on the floor , a dozen or so tables .
on another visit â€” and this is an anecdote that speaks volumes about gascons â€™ trusting nature â€” a stranger in a rugby shirt nonchalantly deposited his child at the table i was sharing with my wife and daughter .
the cafÃ© des sports aside , lectoure is a typical prim and prettified french village , and in this respect is an anomaly in the gers .
the vibe is like that of a small county fair , except with much better food .
the conversations , as a rule , are supercharged by lots of coffee and , often , lubricated by glasses of wine , beer or floc ( an aperitif ) purchased at the buvette , or drinks counter â€” a fixture of any respectable gascon market .
the procuring of provisions always concludes with lunch .

another terrific hike starts in the village of and weaves through the vineyards of madiran .
i â€™ m particularly fond of the latter hike because if you start right after breakfast , you can be done in time to have lunch at the nearby ferme descoubet .

this is sleepy gascony â€™ s even sleepier hinterland .

last year , 82 irish scholars and writers signed an open letter denouncing the irish slave myth and asking publications to stop mentioning it .
without a doubt , life was bad for indentured servants .
they were often treated brutally .
not all of them entered servitude willingly .
some were political prisoners .
some were children .
â€ the legal differences between indentured servitude and chattel slavery were profound , according to matthew reilly , an archaeologist who studies barbados .
they did not pass their unfree status on to descendants .
but in colonial america and the caribbean , the word â€œ slavery â€ had a specific legal meaning .
europeans , by definition , were not included in it .
â€œ it is often about being a prisoner of war or being bought or sold bodily as part of a trade .
central to the memes is the notion that historians and the media are covering up the truth .

some of them are easy to disprove .
they often hijack specific atrocities committed against black slaves and substitute irish people for the actual victims .
it received positive reviews in ireland , however , and was widely read there .
in america , the book connected the white slave narrative to an influential ethnic group of over 34 million people , many of whom had been raised on stories of irish rebellion against britain and tales of bias in america at the turn of the 20th century .

1910,19432 , the verdant food of iran entices at persian new year - the new york times , new york times , samin nosrat,2017-03-20,2017.0,3.0 , , '' pardis stitt still remembers the grocery shopping trips of her childhood in birmingham , ala. : loading into the family car , a silver oldsmobile station wagon with a maroon interior and an player , and wandering the store aisles as her mother tracked down the ingredients for dishes like kuku sabzi , the persian frittata densely packed with an array of green herbs .
but for ms. stitt â€™ s mother , who moved to the united states from iran with her husband in 1963 , preparing food without herbs would be unthinkable .
fresh herbs , both raw and cooked , lie at the foundation of iranian cuisine .
leaving them out would be like making italian food without tomatoes or japanese food without seaweed .
in other words , nearly impossible .
during nowruz ( pronounced ) everyone gathers around a haft sin , a table spread with seven items , including sprouts , which symbolize rebirth , and apples , which represent health and beauty .
the dishes of the nowruz table are verdant and flavorful , like the kuku sabzi that ms. stitt loves .
yet iranian cuisine remains stubbornly unfamiliar in the united states , even as americans have become more interested in middle eastern ingredients and foods like hummus , tahini and pomegranate molasses .
there may not exist a better ambassador for cooking with herbs than hanif sadr .
mr. sadr , 34 , grew up spending nowruz on his family â€™ s farm in the gilan province in northern iran , where he â€™ d harvest herbs and forage for wild fruits and nuts for the holiday dishes .
â€œ in the hills , i found and foraged the same wild hazelnuts , persian hogweed , citrus and green plums we have in iran .
or baghali ghatogh , a dill and fava bean stew scented with garlic and saffron , in which eggs are poached .
â€œ by the time you have finished dinner , you have eaten two whole bunches , â€ he tells them .
â€œ herbs are not just a garnish for us .
it â€™ s traditional to eat fish , a symbol of life , so mr. sadr folds a little fish roe into bij , then stuffs the mixture into trout that he has drizzled with sour orange molasses .
after a short turn in a hot oven , the fish emerges with crisp , brown skin .
the sweet and sour herbs contrast with the delicate , flaky fish without overwhelming it .
â€œ i really want to win people â€™ s hearts with the food i â€™ m cooking .
â€ for mana heshmati , an engineer in detroit who runs a restaurant called peace meal kitchen , the taste of nowruz is sabzi polo , an herbed rice dish that represents prosperity and rebirth .
the rice is parboiled and then tossed with an abundance of herbs and leeks and layered into a preheated pan coated with butter and oil .
as the mixture is spooned into the pan , the bottommost layer of rice sizzles , turning into the crust known as tahdig , while the rest of the rice gently steams until the grains are fluffy .
â€ instead of salad , nearly all persian meals are accompanied by sabzi khordan , a heaping platter of fresh herbs , radishes , walnuts and feta cheese served with flatbread .
sometimes , mr. sadr turns sabzi khordan into a salad for diners who are not accustomed to eating handfuls of undressed raw herbs .
at a recent event , she sold out of 80 servings in 90 minutes .

a billionaire before he hit 50 , he was generating gains for his investors and raking in hundreds of millions in fees for his firm and himself .
hailed as a master investor , he clinched his highflier status in the fall of 2014 by paying $ 90 million with some friends to buy the penthouse at one57 , a aerie in midtown manhattan overlooking central park .
if mr. ackman were a stock , that might have been his peak .
today , things are very different for him .
as much as mr. ackman and investors in his $ 11 billion firm would like to close the book on valeant , they can not do so quite yet .
that â€™ s because of a lawsuit in a federal court in california contending that he and his firm violated securities laws in 2014 .
according to the plaintiffs , pershing square secretly acquired a stake in the pharmaceutical giant allergan based on nonpublic information from valeant that it intended to mount a takeover bid .
this is not just any lawsuit .
damages in the case may be $ 2 billion , as noted by the judge who certified the litigation as a class action wednesday .
mr. ackman â€™ s lawyers , who in court hearings have put potential damages at less than $ 1 billion , are vigorously contesting the case and contend there is no liability .
defendants in the matter , which has not received a lot of publicity recently , are mr. ackman , his funds , valeant and j. michael pearson , the company â€™ s former chief executive .
the documents also show that mr. ackman must set aside 12 hours to answer questions .
mr. pearson was the architect of valeant â€™ s business model , in which the company acquired drugmakers and jacked up prices on their products .
initially , mr. ackman praised mr. pearson â€™ s strategy of acquiring rivals rather than developing drugs internally .
unlike mutual funds , which employ ranks of portfolio managers , hedge funds like pershing square are dominated by the people who run them .
investors in mr. ackman â€™ s firm are essentially placing a bet on him , his acumen and his discipline .
d. ellen shuman is the veteran manager of edgehill endowment partners , which oversees $ 650 million in nonprofit money .
why ?
through march 15 , pershing square is flat .
and it is not clear whether or to what extent mr. ackman â€™ s investors have reacted to his firm â€™ s losses by fleeing .
pershing square declined to disclose redemption figures .
as is typical with hedge funds , pershing square has rules governing client redemptions .
and several years ago , mr. ackman astutely raised permanent capital with a stock offering in europe , another cushion against a run on the firm .
and his protracted $ 1 billion crusade against herbalife , a maker of health supplements , has lost money for his investors .
finally , there â€™ s his previous hedge fund , gotham partners , which ran into trouble when clients redeemed and its illiquid investments could not be sold quickly .
for example , mr. ackman â€™ s $ 4 billion loss in valeant more than wiped out the $ 2 .
2 billion he made in 2014 on allergan .
mr. ackman had never invested in the pharmaceutical industry when he put over $ 3 billion into allergan .
after generating a quick $ 2 .
2 billion profit in allergan , mr. ackman continued his new interest in pharma .
in march 2015 , pershing began putting about $ 4 billion into valeant .
â€ he added : â€œ but the moment we could , we bought it .
although few suspected it , that was the zenith for valeant .
by september the stock had fallen to around $ 160 .
on oct. 30 , mr. ackman battled back with a conference call defending valeant .
â€ from then on , valeant was essentially in free fall .
in late december 2015 , mr. pearson took a medical leave .
as valeant â€™ s business flagged , investors began focusing on its $ 30 billion debt , taken on to acquire companies .
and in july of that year , he told an interviewer that valeant â€™ s phone was ringing off the hook because so many companies wanted to buy the assets it was selling .
by this time , the stock had drifted down into the $ 20s .
4 billion loss .
last monday , mr. ackman had had enough .
as this calamity played out , mr. ackman was also fighting the allergan lawsuit in california .
the plaintiffs were investors who had missed out on gains in allergan stock in 2014 because they had sold shares without knowing about valeant â€™ s impending bid , while pershing square , which did know about it , was buying allergan shares .
it would have been very costly for valeant to finance a takeover of allergan instead it struck an agreement on feb. 25 , 2014 , allowing pershing square to take a nearly 10 percent stake in allergan to support valeant â€™ s takeover efforts .
if the bid succeeded , wonderful .
pershing set up an entity called ps fund 1 and began buying .
by april 21 , it held a 9 .
7 percent stake in allergan worth $ 3 .
2 billion , court documents show .
but the arrangement between pershing square and valeant was not disclosed until the following day , when valeant said it intended to acquire allergan .
â€ allergan rejected valeant â€™ s offer and was acquired by actavis p. l. c. a pharmaceutical company , the next november .
6 billion profit it gave $ 400 million of that to valeant .
critics of the arrangement cried foul , contending that pershing had profited from its knowledge of valeant â€™ s impending bid , essentially the deal , or trading on nonpublic information .
and a month later , investors filed suit against valeant and pershing square .
mr. ackman and his lawyers have contended that pershing square did not violate any laws .
lawyers for mr. ackman have argued in court that a january order from the securities and exchange commission fining allergan $ 15 million for disclosure failures during the valeant bid supports their case .
but judge carter expressed skepticism .
according to the transcript of a feb. 13 hearing , he questioned why he should accept the s. e. c. order as a finding of fact in the allergan case .
asked if any of its clients had expressed concern about the case , pershing declined to comment .
and the settlement deal , described in a regulatory filing on feb. 13 , expires in november .
it is unclear what will happen after that .

but mr. rockefeller was more than a steward .
he was received in foreign capitals with the honors accorded a chief of state .
in silent testimony to his power and reach was his rolodex , a catalog of some 150 , 000 names of people he had met as a .

â€œ obviously , there are times when i â€™ m aware that i â€™ m treated differently .

â€œ he will go down as a real personality , as a distinguished and loyal member of the community .
he turned them both down .
only jay rockefeller , a of john d. rockefeller , had earned prominence , as a governor and united states senator from west virginia .
his father , john d. rockefeller jr. the only son of the oil titan , devoted his life to philanthropy .

another son , richard , died in 2014 at 65 when the small plane he was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff from westchester county airport .
he was discharged a captain in 1945 .
banking in the early postwar era was a gentleman â€™ s profession .
mr. rockefeller found plenty of time for such activities .
he courted art collectors .
in 1968 , he put together a syndicate , including his brother nelson and the cbs chairman , william s. paley , to buy gertrude stein â€™ s collection of modern art .
david and peggy rockefeller â€™ s own prized paintings â€” by cÃ©zanne , gauguin , matisse , picasso â€” were lent to the museum permanently .
mr. rockefeller â€™ s rise in banking was swift .
â€œ i couldn â€™ t disagree more .
â€ by 1976 , chase manhattan â€™ s international arm was contributing 80 percent of the bank â€™ s $ 105 million in operating profit .
it also owned more new securities than any other bank in the when the city was edging toward bankruptcy .
chase also got caught up in a scandal in 1974 .
an internal audit discovered that its bond trading account was overvalued by $ 34 million and that losses had been understated .
a resulting $ 15 million drain in net income tarnished the bank â€™ s image .
in 1975 , the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency branded chase a â€œ problem â€ bank .
at the same time , he put his bank â€™ s affairs in order .
by 1981 , he and his protÃ©gÃ© willard c. butcher had restored chase manhattan to full health .
3 billion , pocketing an estimated $ 300 million .
before the year ended , mr. rockefeller put together a syndicate that bought control of rockefeller center .
then , in 2000 , it was sold in a $ 1 .
85 billion deal that severed the center â€™ s last ties with the rockefeller family .
as an octogenarian , mr. rockefeller , whose fortune was estimated in 2012 at $ 2 .
7 billion , increasingly devoted himself to philanthropy , donating tens of millions of dollars in particular to harvard , the museum of modern art and the rockefeller university , which john d. rockefeller sr. founded in 1901 .
the occasion was mr. rockefeller â€™ s 90th birthday , and at the end of the evening , he was presented with a birthday cake modeled after his house in maine .

he was 87 .
rea s. hederman , the publisher of the review , confirmed the death .
she died in december .
mr. silvers is survived by nieces and nephews .
it was routine for him to hunt down contributors on their vacations .
the phone call was not unknown .
most writers regarded him with admiration verging on awe .
â€ robert benjamin silvers was born on dec. 31 , 1929 , in mineola , n. y. a village on long island .
his father , james , was a businessman who left manhattan to live the rural life .
he pursued an accelerated program , earning a bachelor â€™ s degree in 1947 .
mr. silvers spent three semesters studying law , without enthusiasm , at yale .
he studied at the sorbonne and sciences po .
a .
â€œ it seemed to me quite a natural thing , â€ mr. silvers told the guardian of his decision to take up editing as a vocation .
the timing was perfect .
they had in mind a literary review on the model of the times literary supplement in london , or the literary section of the british magazine the new statesman under v. s. pritchett : a forum for writers to discuss ideas , books , ideas and politics at length , provocatively .
the print run of 100 , 000 sold out .
â€œ we like important questions to be dealt with by experts with strong views , â€ he told time magazine in 1967 .
he also liked to let writers roam , figuratively and literally , freed from the constraints imposed by most american publications .
â€ over the years , the review became famous for essays that often dealt only glancingly with the multiple book titles , sometimes as many as a dozen , nominally under consideration .
mr. silvers liked to match writers with unexpected subjects .
â€ applying the same logic to political writing , he sent ms. mccarthy to hanoi , vietnam , and a reluctant v. s. naipaul to the 1984 republican national convention in dallas .
when joan didion and her husband , john gregory dunne , traveled to el salvador in 1982 , mr. silvers coaxed a series of long dispatches from her on the difficult situation of a country in the grip of a dictatorship .
it later became a book , â€œ salvador .
in other words , it was the travel piece carried to its logical and not very interesting conclusion .
â€ with ms. epstein as his and a. whitney ellsworth as publisher , mr. silvers kept the review in the thick of literary and political debate in the 1960s .
the issue of aug. 24 , 1967 , epitomized its political stance .
chaos or community ?
politics never faded entirely from the picture .
petitions and essays on behalf of political prisoners and victims of human rights violations were a constant feature .
â€œ i don â€™ t like accepting anything as having its own necessary authority , â€ he told the guardian in 2004 .
the same writers showed up in issue after issue , and for a time , the review was jokingly called the new york review of each other â€™ s books .
recapturing its militant spirit of the 1960s , he filled its pages with long , scathing critiques of the government â€™ s diplomacy , its conduct of the wars and its record on civil liberties .

the united nations security council has banned the country from satellite launchings , considering its satellite program a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile .

the apology , announced in december along with a $ 400 million strategy to combat the epidemic and â€œ provide material assistance and support â€ for victims , amounted to a rare public act of contrition by the united nations .

other countries have provided additional sources of funding for haiti outside the trust fund , most notably canada , at about $ 4 .
6 million , and japan , at $ 2 .
6 million , according to the united nations .
he also appeared to raise the possibility of a mandatory dues assessment if there were no significant pledges .
mr. guterres has not stated publicly whether he intends to push for a mandatory assessment in the budget negotiations now underway at the united nations .
the united states , historically a leading source of haiti â€™ s foreign aid , is also the biggest single financing source for the united nations , which may now confront painful choices over how to allocate reduced revenue .
â€ mr. trump â€™ s new united nations ambassador , nikki r. haley , who has called the cholera crisis â€œ nothing short of devastating , â€ did not respond to requests for comment about the funding problem .
â€ cholera , a waterborne bacterial scourge that can cause acute diarrhea and fatal dehydration if not treated quickly , has killed nearly 10 , 000 people and sickened nearly 800 , 000 in haiti , the western hemisphere â€™ s poorest country , since it was introduced there in 2010 by infected nepalese members of a united nations peacekeeping force .
â€ compared with other disasters confronting the united nations , like the syria refugee crisis and famines threatening 20 million people in yemen and parts of africa , the haiti crisis may not loom as large .
but unlike the others , the direct cause in haiti was traced to the united nations .
â€ lawmakers in the united states critical of the united nations â€™ response in haiti have also put pressure on the organization .

few dance inventors have so combined the cerebral and sensuous sides of dance as ms. brown did , and few have been as influential .
patricia ann brown was born on nov. 25 , 1936 , to the former dorothy louise abel , an english teacher , and martell w. brown , a salesman .
some dances were performed barefoot , others in sneakers .
in 1978 she took her â€œ accumulation â€ solo and embellished it , showing , in â€œ accumulation with talking plus water motor , â€ just how many things could be done simultaneously .
she could coordinate several physical acts while talking , as if illustrating multiple trains of thought in action .
the style was often called â€œ release technique , â€ and some accredited its invention to her .
ms. brown , a gently but memorably witty woman , simply described her own idiom as â€œ the line of least resistance , â€ neatly evoking the rippling of impulses and ricochets that characterized much of her dance .

all dance legacies are fragile hers may prove especially so .
that motto of hers , â€œ the line of least resistance , â€ has sometimes suggested her own limitations : her work has often seemed to lack drama .

1934,19458 , that â€™ s not the burglar growling .

this is a story about a small and bizarre subset of those objects , evidence left by criminals feeding that most basic of human appetites .

that violation was last seen in this space earlier this month , in the tale of a brooklyn man whose attempt to rent his apartment to a stranger went terribly awry .
but the phenomenon of the hungry burglar is timeless .

my wife is similarly resistant to the enchantment .

but at least it is a minstrelsy .
can it be true ?
the aloha spirit is real ?

i am not constitutionally geared for paradise .
hawaii is notoriously nice , and unremitting niceness is what i do not want out of a vacation .
this is because i â€™ m cheap .
i want a maximum memory harvest for my travel dollar , and a trip rarely sticks in my storage cache without the sharp edges of mishap and discomfort to snag on .
in a gesture of spiritual surrender , i have booked a stay in the hawaiian islands with no greater hope for the voyage than that it may be merely nice .
i put on an shirt i have lacked the courage to wear since i bought it years ago in thailand .

1943,19468 , pop a pill for heartburn ?
yet , every medication has side effects , some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat .
drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards , both bothersome and severe , that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time .
acid reflux is more than just a nuisance .
it involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it .
an examination of the esophagus may be the only way to find out if someone without obvious heartburn has acid reflux but doesn â€™ t know it .
someone with a body mass index in the overweight range is almost twice as likely to have gerd as a person of normal weight .
quitting smoking , limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures .
eating big meals , lying down before a meal is digested , and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms .
for further protection , the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more .
but while certain common foods â€” like raw onions , garlic , citrus juices , coffee and chocolate â€” are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition , dr. aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different , and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual â€™ s trigger foods and drinks .
specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two , recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person â€™ s trigger foods .
a food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome .
foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest .
accordingly , the â€œ healing â€ diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural , unprocessed foods , especially lean protein foods like poultry , fish , egg whites and dairy , beans ( combined with whole grains ) and nonacidic vegetables and fruits .
foods are very helpful , â€œ second only to eliminating acidic foods , â€ dr. aviv said .
good sources include broccoli , carrots , beets , green leafy vegetables , apples , berries , bananas , avocados and pears .
other helpful foods include almonds , walnuts , lentils , chickpeas and lima beans .
if adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux , taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed .
â€œ studies have revealed that 80 percent of americans may be taking these powerful meds incorrectly , â€ dr. aviv wrote .
it is usually treatable and not often fatal .
but some women may need chemotherapy and radiation .

- the new york times , new york times , chris dixon and kevin sack,2017-03-22,2017.0,3.0 , , '' charleston , s. c. â€” joseph c. meek jr. a friend of dylann s. roof â€™ s who spent time with him in the weeks before nine people were killed at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church here , was sentenced tuesday to 27 months in prison for hampering and misleading the federal authorities in the aftermath of mr. roof â€™ s racist massacre .
the punishment , handed down by judge richard m. gergel of federal district court , was at the low end of the sentencing guidelines , which called for mr. meek to spend from 27 to 33 months in prison .
mr. meek â€™ s lawyer , deborah b. barbier , expressed concern that her client would be forced to spend his sentence in solitary confinement because of security risks .
roof told mr. meek that he wanted to kill black people at a historic african methodist episcopal church in charleston in order to start a race riot , according to f. b. i. summaries of interviews with him .
roof , provided little information about what may have incited him to act so violently on his racist beliefs .
they largely lost touch when mr .
roof moved away but reconnected via facebook on may 22 , 2015 , less than a month before the massacre .
mr .
roof began hanging out at the trailer where mr. meek lived with his girlfriend and other family members .
mr. meek dismissed the seriousness and did not notify the authorities .
mr. tyler held off that night .
roof from a church security camera began circulating , mr. tyler became the first person to call a police tip line and identify the gunman , according to a search warrant .
mr .
roof was arrested later that morning in north carolina with the murder weapon in the back seat .
roof had not spoken of a target for his attack , according to assistant united states attorney julius n. richardson .
but in a second interview , mr. meek admitted that he had lied , according to an f. b. i. synopsis of the session .
he also admitted that on the night of the shootings , after concluding that mr .
roof was responsible for the attack , he told others not to contact law enforcement .
in his conversations with investigators , mr. meek described mr .
he did not perceive mr .
roof as depressed or as having an anger problem .
when mr. meek was first charged and agreed to a plea deal , the expectation was that he would testify in mr. roof â€™ s trial about the killer â€™ s premeditation and planning .
mr. richardson declined to comment on tuesday , as did the relatives of mr. roof â€™ s victims who attended the sentencing .

eventually , they may take on features of a mature human being .
in the report , john d. aach and his colleagues explored the ethics of creating what they call â€œ synthetic human entities with embryolike features â€ â€” sheefs , for short .
such a sheef might reveal important clues about how nerves control heartbeats .
established guidelines for human embryo research are useless for deciding which sheefs will be acceptable and which not , dr. aach argued .
during that time , the embryos each divided into 16 cells .
the discovery also made it possible to study the earliest moments of human development .
it is where the spine will later develop .
there are even more important changes happening at the same time , although they are harder to see .
the embryonic cells develop into three types , called germ layers .
in 1998 , scientists isolated stem cells from early embryos and eventually figured out how to develop them into just about any tissue in the body , from heart muscle to nerves .
for decades , scientists did not break the rule â€” but only because they did not know how .
while these artificial embryos developed from embryonic stem cells , it may soon become possible to build them from reprogrammed adult human cells .
henry t. greely of stanford university was less optimistic .
while it is important to have a discussion about sheefs , he said , it may be hard to reach an agreement on limits as enforceable as the rule .
even if ethicists do manage to agree on certain limits , paul s. knoepfler , a stem cell biologist at the university of california , davis , wondered how easy it would be for scientists to know if they had crossed them .

i stamped to knock the snow from my skis , then pushed off , carving easy turns in the groomed track that spilled through groves of larch trees , sascha following behind .
i jammed to a stop , looked back and saw a tangle of limbs , skis and poles .
â€œ i â€™ m stuck ! â€ sascha had taken a fall and lost his poles , but his skis had stayed on his feet , which were pinned underneath him .
â€œ it hurts .
â€ ugh .
after a few comforting words and a suggestion that we take it easy , we set off side by side .
â€™ â€ ouch .
i knew abstractly that sascha and his younger sister were feeling my absence .
our interactions were limited to frantic mornings hustling them off to school and fleeting kisses when i returned from work .
sascha was old enough to travel with me by himself , i decided .
it would add an element of adventure â€” and be considerably cheaper .
rolling the dice , i booked tickets on the train , found a promising pension , the hotel de l â€™ europe , in the nearby town of le â€” and immediately started worrying about the lack of snow , anxiously watching as webcams revealed a brownish , parched landscape .
our train clattered into the gare d â€™ austerlitz , looking dowdy compared with the sleek trains that are replacing the night routes across europe .
sascha was happy in his nest with a reading light , a thin sleeping sack and a water bottle , and plunked himself on his stomach so he could look out the window .
awaking at the station in brianÃ§on , we hopped on a shuttle bus that would take us to le .
we clambered off at the edge of town and walked a few hundred meters up the rustic rue st. .
â€œ keep to the middle of the mountain , â€ we were told â€” up high it would be windy and foggy later in the day , possibly stormy , and down below the snow cover was a little thin .
on the advice of the ski shop , we started with an intermediate run , rochamout , where sascha fell .
around 2 p. m. we decided to take the long chairlift from the middle of the mountain to a natural , treeless pass with the jolly name of cucumelle .
clearly , this was test no .

we inched into the teeth of this unexpected storm and after a few agonizing minutes , found ourselves back among the calm of the trees .
( sarah finat , his wife , had greeted us in the morning . )
traditional chairlifts predominate in serre chevalier , so we had plenty of time to talk on the way up .
there , i washed down an escalope de veau milanaise with fresh tagliatelle with a hearty savoyard red .
suffused with we skied as the french do after lunch , sticking to the sunniest runs and heading down early .
our destination was le monÃªtier â€™ s other attraction : mineral baths dating to roman times .
by 5 p. m. we were soaking in a warm , bubbly pool , gazing up at the gathering dusk on the slopes .
we headed straight up to explore more of serre chevalier , which has 102 marked trails , 61 lifts and nearly 10 , 000 acres within its boundaries .
his call was to ski the terrain park , eliciting a silent groan from my arthritic left hip .
on saturday , our last day , we felt confident enough to take on some of the nearly empty expert slopes , which overnight had been draped in fresh powder .
after another decadent soak in the thermal baths , we grabbed dinner at the excellent pizza nono , then took the shuttle back to the brianÃ§on train station .
there were no complaints from sascha , no dawdling .
i sensed that sascha was feeling some of the same melancholy .
suddenly â€” boom !
it was the â€™ 80s , and and oversized clothes were the styles of the moment .
we traveled around the city performing for kids in public schools .

we added slang , spanglish and .
we did impressions of michael jackson and stevie wonder .
â€ things like that .
man , to see those kids squealing and jumping up from their seats was the biggest highlight of my life .
i realized how important it was for them to see themselves and their culture reflected back to them , something the media of the time rarely attempted .
especially in my manhattan .
but the biggest service being provided was what the kids gave me .
i figured if these latin kids were into what i was doing , then latin adults might be , too .
i saw that even though i was talking about latin life , they , too , were hungry for an understanding of this sister culture to their own .
but i soon saw that the boundaries were mostly in my own head .
what i saw on tv and in movies and books did not apply to the real world .

â€ judge gorsuch smiled .
they may as well have .
but this year , republicans have elevated the practice to high art â€” supplying extra cushioning for a nominee who does not appear to need it and adding a measure of levity to a process that virtually all inside the capitol agree will end with a confirmation .
on matters fraught and frivolous , senate allies have coaxed judge gorsuch to the safest of verbal eager to defuse democratic lines of attack with whimsy and digressions .

keep in mind that snacking contributes to weight gain , and studies have found that nearly of the calories we eat come from snacks .
a banana , apple or other fresh fruit , a small portion of cottage cheese or plain yogurt with sliced fruit , or oatmeal or some other cereal with skim milk were frequent suggestions made by experts interviewed for this article .
other suggestions included raw veggie sticks , a couple of whole grain crackers with a small slice of cheese , a handful of almonds or other nuts , or celery sticks spread with a tablespoon or two of peanut butter or almond butter ( measure the nuts and butters â€” don â€™ t eat them straight out of the container ) .
if you â€™ re in the mood for something salty and crunchy , popcorn may fit the bill , suggested laura smith , a product manager for weight watchers .

try drinking more throughout the day , and having more water or carbonated water with dinner .

although the house republicans â€™ meeting became a cheerleading session for the bill , their leaders braced for a showdown on the floor , knowing they were likely to be at least a handful of votes short of a majority for the health insurance bill and would need to muscle their colleagues to the last to prevail .
some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates .
mr. ryan had earlier postponed the initial house vote that was scheduled for thursday to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the affordable care act â€™ s signing .
at a white house meeting with members of the freedom caucus earlier on thursday , mr. trump had agreed to the conservatives â€™ demands to strip federal health insurance requirements for basic benefits such as maternity care , emergency services , mental health and wellness visits from the bill .
but that was not enough to placate the faction , part of the reason that thursday â€™ s vote was placed on hold .
â€œ this is it â€” we â€™ re voting now .
that â€™ d be a stupid damn vote .
â€ others were unconvinced .
â€œ there â€™ s a little bit of a balancing act , â€ conceded sean spicer , the white house press secretary .
the nonpartisan congressional budget office on thursday issued a report on the revised version of the health care bill showing that it would cost more than the original version but would not cover more people .
instead of reducing the deficit by $ 337 billion , the new version of the bill would save only $ 150 billion over the decade .
the measure did not even draw support among a majority of republicans 41 percent approved , while 24 percent were opposed .
mr. obama stepped into the fray on thursday with a lengthy defense of his law on the seventh anniversary of its signing , and a call for bipartisan improvements .
â€ the affordable care act requires insurers to provide â€œ essential health benefits â€ in 10 broad categories , including maternity care , mental health care , addiction treatment , preventive services , emergency services and rehabilitative services .

the killer turned out to be homegrown , a briton , khalid masood , who had a criminal record but was not on any lists .
the islamic state , which rejects peace and coexistence , described mr. masood on thursday as a disciple and a hero for the assault carried out a day earlier in the shadow of big ben .
mr. masood plowed a rented hyundai sport utility vehicle through pedestrians on the westminster bridge , killing two and injuring at least 40 crashed the vehicle into a fence and then emerged brandishing knives to fatally stab the constable before other police officers shot and killed him .
â€œ yesterday , an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy , â€ prime minister theresa may told parliament , addressing colleagues who a day earlier had been placed on lockdown for hours .
â€ she called the violence â€œ an attack on free people everywhere .
it was there , in the spring hill neighborhood , that mr. masood rented from an enterprise branch the hyundai tucson that he used in the attack .
mr. masood had a record of convictions , from 1983 to 2003 , for assault , weapons possession and violations of public order .
last year , security services foiled a bomb plot in birmingham , linked to extremists .
the group has called for attacks on britain , and mr. masood â€™ s assault was reminiscent of attacks in france and germany carried out with vehicles .

the injured also included three boys from the brittany region of france who were on the bridge with other visiting students and who sustained leg and arm fractures .
five south koreans were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site , according to the south korean foreign ministry .
a woman , however , required surgery for a head injury , according to south korean news reports .
mr. burnaz â€™ s foot was fractured .
the palace of westminster , which includes the houses of parliament , is a bewildering warren of corridors , and the work of ensuring that it was clear of assailants took time in the immediate aftermath of the assault .
that may have been partly because an attack of this type had not been completely unexpected .

most of the other planned school trips to london on thursday or friday have been postponed .

they were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site , according to the south korean foreign ministry .
a woman , however , suffered a head injury when she was pushed by the fleeing crowd , according to south korean news reports .

last week , the congolese military â€™ s auditor general announced that seven officers had been arrested and charged with war crimes after a video surfaced last month depicting soldiers shooting a group of civilians in province , a massacre that left at least 13 dead .
amid mounting accusations of violence against civilians , and the discovery of 10 mass graves dug in january and february in the chief of the united nations peacekeeping mission in congo urged the united nations security council this week to press the government to open an investigation into possible rights violations .
in congo , elected officials and rights advocates are calling for an international investigation .
fighting between soldiers and rebels has left hundreds dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of people since august .
province is volatile , with frequent clashes despite the presence of united nations peacekeepers .
he added that an investigation was needed to determine who had been killed and how , adding that the victims should be given a dignified burial . ''
an intensive investigation spanning multiple countries culminated on thursday in the arrest of the suspect , who holds dual israeli and american citizenship , and his father .
he said his client , who also has no criminal record , was concerned primarily with his son â€™ s welfare , given his medical condition .
in his brief court appearance , the suspect , wearing khaki cargo pants , bowed his head and pulled up his shirt to conceal his face .
on thursday morning , after months of investigation and waves of turmoil and panic , the federal bureau of investigation held a conference call with leaders of jewish organizations to discuss the surprising denouement to the investigation .
â€œ these were acts that terrorized a community just because of their faith .
when the israeli police searched the suspect â€™ s house , investigators confiscated computers , an antenna and other equipment .

the ministry of defense was sending additional troops to patrol .
soldiers on a routine patrol noticed the vehicle and signaled to the driver to stop , but he ignored them and drove through a red light , again putting pedestrians in danger .
once the car stopped , the suspect did not resist as he was taken into custody , bystanders told local news media .
the investigation was being handled by the federal prosecutor â€™ s office , an indication that the attack would be treated as a terrorist case unless proved otherwise .

r. kleinfield,2017-03-28,2017.0,3.0 , , '' since he was a boy he has hated black men .
a bitter hatred of black men that boiled in his mind and consumed him .
then last week , apparently , he decided to kill them .
he had registered few obvious traces of who he was and what he stood for .
by all accounts , timothy caughman , 66 , was a benevolent man content with an unassuming life .
he lived in a former single room occupancy residence that had been his longtime home .
religion and philosophy were constants in his conversations over unhurried meals of turkey bacon and grits at local diners .
just after midnight on wednesday , he surrendered to the police and took responsibility for the murder .
he was arraigned on thursday in supreme court in manhattan and charged with murder as a hate crime .

he did not enter a plea .
sam talkin , mr. jackson â€™ s defense lawyer , declined to comment on the specifics of the case .
if the information put forth by the authorities is accurate , he added , they will have to deal with mr. jackson â€™ s â€œ obvious psychological issues .
but he was blunt about his prejudices when questioned by detectives .
according to a law enforcement official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the investigation is continuing , â€œ he told the cops , â€˜ i â€™ ve hated black men since i was a kid .
i hate black men .
â€™ â€ mr. jackson told detectives , according to the official , that his intention was to keep on killing , the first attack being a springboard .
investigators have not yet determined the origins of this hate .
in 2007 , he graduated from the friends school of baltimore , a small and prestigious quaker day school .
â€œ the entire friends school community extends our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of timothy caughman .
he was deployed to afghanistan between december 2010 and november 2011 .
afterward , he was stationed in baumholder , germany , before being discharged in august 2012 , when his rank was specialist .
in the spring of 2015 , he was nearly evicted from an apartment building in baltimore â€™ s mount vernon neighborhood for falling behind on his rent , according to marcus dagan , who was filling in then as the building â€™ s manager .
he began eviction proceedings , but mr. jackson left before they were completed .

timothy caughman was bent over some garbage .
he was born in jamaica , queens , and grew up in a comfortable apartment in the south jamaica houses .
he was the son of tula caughman , a home health care aide for wealthy residents of nearby jamaica estates , and william caughman , the pastor of mount zion baptist church .

the drill can be repeated for 15 or 20 minutes .
the drill is a exercise that lasts for five minutes as players rotate in and out .

so at the fifth edition of art basel hong kong , which runs through saturday , spectators were seizing the chance to do just that , posing with an eerily lifelike model of a mao on display in a clear coffin .
arranged beside mao were several other communist strongmen : ho chi minh , kim fidel castro and vladimir lenin .
â€œ but then , last year , i bought $ 300 , 000 of art at the fair and i couldn â€™ t remit directly to the gallery , so i sent renminbi to a friend , who helped me settle it abroad .

ever the optimists , many noted that , as is typical of the fair here , collectors were taking their time to learn about the artists , putting down reserves and finalizing the purchases later .
nonetheless , the fair had a steady stream of sales .

allegations of questionable ties to the russian government forced out his national security adviser , michael t. flynn .
â€™ â€ mr. trump expressed weariness with the effort , though its failure took a fraction of the time that democrats devoted to enacting the affordable care act in 2009 and 2010 .
mr. trump later told journalists in the oval office that republicans were 10 to 15 votes short of what they needed to pass the repeal bill .
â€œ probably that champagne that wasn â€™ t popped back in november may be utilized this evening , â€ mr. walker said .
the meeting lasted five minutes .
the republican bill would have repealed tax penalties for people without health insurance , rolled back federal insurance standards , reduced subsidies for the purchase of private insurance and set new limits on spending for medicaid , the program that covers more than 70 million people .
the budget office also warned that in the short run , the republicans â€™ legislation would drive insurance premiums higher .
â€ the bill died after republican leaders , in a bid for conservative support , agreed to eliminate federal standards for the minimum benefits that must be provided by certain health insurance policies .
â€œ if â€˜ no â€™ is your goal , it â€™ s the easiest goal in the world to reach .
they win today .
â€ â€œ the freedom caucus wins , â€ he added .
â€ ''
â€œ it is exploding now .
in fact , obamacare is not on the verge of â€œ explosion .
the house has argued that the money for those subsidies was not properly authorized .
the obama white house fought the case .
there are smaller decisions ahead , too , about how to administer programs , whether to enforce the law â€™ s individual mandate , and whether to recruit insurers to participate in markets where competition is thin .
it would do nothing to isolate or punish the freedom caucus , the conservative faction that had resisted the measure all along , he added .
mr. trump remained unconvinced , but by midafternoon , armed with vote counts showing that the measure lacked a majority to pass , the president called the speaker to agree : you should pull the bill .
mr. trump , who initially had little involvement in crafting the health care bill , became more deeply engaged in recent weeks , promoting it at rallies outside washington and holding meetings in the west wing with conservative and moderate coalitions whose support was crucial to its passage .
called on in turn to state their positions , several members refused .
mr. ryan postponed the vote and called an evening meeting of house republicans in the basement of the capitol .
but mr. ryan , reluctant to suffer an embarrassing loss or to ask his fellow republicans to take what could be a politically perilous vote on a measure that had little chance of passing , argued vigorously against it .
he tried very hard .
â€œ if i were , i wouldn â€™ t be calling you .
but he acknowledged that he was pleased to have it all behind him .
they now own obamacare .
â€ although enrollment in the affordable care act declined slightly in the past year , there is no sign that it is collapsing .
he singled out the tuesday group moderates for praise , calling them â€œ terrific , â€ an implicit jab at the house freedom caucus , which his aides had expressed frustration with during negotiations .
he talked on a speaker phone from his desk in the oval office , with a coterie of aides drifting by .
he emphatically did not fault mr. ryan .
he tried very hard .
â€ â€œ i â€™ m not disappointed , â€ he insisted .
â€œ if i were , i wouldn â€™ t be calling you .
â€ ''
here is an assessment of his claims .
false .
â€œ we will immediately repeal and replace obamacare â€” and nobody can do that like me .
this is misleading .
republicans needed 215 votes in the house to pass the bill .
they have 237 out of the 435 seats , meaning they could afford only 22 party defections .
before the bill was pulled , 33 republicans were opposed .
this is exaggerated .

on friday , the company sold its stake in seaworld to zhonghong group , a chinese investment firm , for about $ 449 million .
but owning seaworld became a liability to its reputation after â€œ blackfish â€ debuted at the 2013 sundance film festival .

on thursday , the service lyft became the latest example , removing their ads after they appeared next to videos from a racist skinhead group .
unlike television , with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising , youtube mirrors the internet â€™ s sprawl , specializing in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers .
but more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to youtube every minute , and while google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material â€œ in the vast majority of cases , â€ it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time .
and that has advertisers increasingly concerned .
this has opened up the whole of the internet to brands , which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavory sites , rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations .
that is a radical departure .
not long ago , brands like procter gamble were in fact funding tv shows such as â€œ gilmore girls , â€ â€œ 7th heaven â€ and â€œ sabrina , the teenage witch â€ because they wanted more platforms for â€œ family friendly â€ content .
â€œ now to 2017 , and google â€™ s display network alone has two million sites .
â€ that sheer scale , coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears , has been google â€™ s main defense .
the model has minted stars , some of whom gain cultlike followings for edgy and inappropriate content .
he was part of youtube â€™ s premium advertising product called google preferred â€” a category of popular , â€œ brand safe â€ videos on youtube .
google has pledged that youtube will tighten safeguards against ads showing up alongside â€œ hateful , offensive and derogatory content â€ while reviewing guidelines for what type of content is allowable on the platform .
internet ad revenue in the united states , which is growing quickly , reached about $ 60 billion in 2015 while television accounted for about $ 66 billion , according to a study from iab and pwc .

and memory is an interpretation of the past , not a literal playback of it .
my own daughter , who has a serious disability called rett syndrome , is just three years younger than the laura .
you bet .
â€ broadway audiences are accustomed to seeing perfect bodies doing entertaining dance steps .
guess what , broadway ?
ryan haddad , who is gay and has cerebral palsy , steals the show with a funny , deeply personal piece called â€œ hi , are you single ? â€ this is the type of production that â€™ s most likely to showcase actors with disabilities : intimate theater , small audience , $ 25 ticket .
mr. gold â€™ s brashest stroke in a production full of them may be the bridging of that divide â€” taking a theatrical universe that has existed for some time on the outskirts and putting it on a broadway marquee featuring the names of mr. mantello and sally field , who plays amanda .
some theatergoers were probably outraged the first time a black juliet was cast against a white romeo .
sure .
yes .
if you figure out that thing with keeping the house lights up for a third of the show , let me know .

â€ it â€™ s worth contemplating what that means from the audience â€™ s perspective .
probably not .
i don â€™ t really care whether this is what williams intended .
does he cede power to the wing of his party ?
the president is a deal maker , and ronald reagan cut some of his most important deals with democrats .
in a search for scapegoats , he asked his advisers repeatedly : whose fault was this ?
and they were stunned by his inability to master the politics of his own conference .
you have the conservative players .
â€ but his advisers were more realistic .
aides advised him the argument was nonsensical , according to a person with knowledge of the interaction .
as a candidate in 2016 , he initially scoffed at signing a republican loyalty pledge , at times behaving more like an independent invading the republican host organism than like a typical presidential candidate .
republicans who gained power by savaging washington are in full control and can not agree on a path forward .

but the chief wild card , as ever , is mr. trump .
â€œ i want to thank paul ryan .
â€œ i will tell you that .
â€œ he â€™ s really been fantastic .
mr. trump is also known to grow angrier over time , particularly if faced with public embarrassment .
â€œ this is not .
â€ ''
mr. trump â€” who sold himself as a winner who could turn around a country that â€œ doesn â€™ t win anymore â€ â€” has endured a litany of missteps , controversies , resignations and investigations , all of which have dented his â€œ i alone can fix it â€ vow to remake government with businesslike efficiency .
â€œ he can not delegate .
investigations can drain the political life from a presidency , as ronald reagan found during the scandal and mr. clinton learned during the monica lewinsky investigations .

2040,19571 , renegotiate nafta ?
there has been an abrupt slowdown in foreign investment , pinching off capital as investors wait to see how things shake out .
add to that a fluttering peso , lowered growth expectations , rising interest rates and looming political headwinds , and the urgency becomes clear .
mexico , and its investors , need certainty .
â€œ the longer he is in the presidency , from today forward , the more of a lame duck he is .
at the same time , there is a growing awareness that dealing with nafta , a campaign priority for mr. trump , has suddenly taken a back seat to more pressing battles .
and mexicans have taken note .
that , according to some , could be disastrous for those hoping to preserve nafta .
2041,19572 , u.s.-led coalition confirms strikes hit mosul site where civilians died - the new york times , new york times , michael s. schmidt and tim arango,2017-03-26,2017.0,3.0 , , '' washington â€” the military coalition in iraq said saturday that an initial review of recent airstrikes in mosul , the islamic state â€™ s last stronghold in iraq , had confirmed that the strikes hit a site where scores of civilians were killed .

while some of the polish banks took the hackers â€™ bait , the scheme was detected fairly quickly , and there is no evidence that any money was stolen from the intended targets .
the security firm symantec said it believed that the hackers behind the poland attack were also behind two other major breaches : the theft of $ 81 million from the central bank of bangladesh and a 2014 attack on sony pictures , which rocked the film industry .
and on tuesday , richard ledgett , a deputy director of the national security agency , said that research linked the sony pictures attack to the bangladesh heist .
he also affirmed that he believed nation states were now robbing banks .
north korea has denied involvement in the attacks on sony and others , instead accusing south korea of disrupting its websites .
the attack began around october when the hackers planted a virus on the website of the polish financial regulator â€” then waited for banks to inadvertently download it when they visited the site .
the central banks of russia , venezuela , mexico , chile and the czech republic were on the list .
north korea has been carefully cultivating its cyberattack capabilities since the early 1990s , according to south korean officials .
generally , the country selects young computer prodigies and trains them as hackers , according to people who have attended the south korean government â€™ s discussions of the north â€™ s hacking operations .
south korean cybersecurity officials began detecting attacks attributed to north korean hackers around 2009 .
the hackers demand a ransom , usually in bitcoin , in return for providing victims with a decryption code .

as 2016 turned to 2017 and the yearlong commitments began to expire , the question of how the newcomers would fare acquired a national nickname : month 13 , when the syrians would try to stand on their own .
but the improvised family had a deadline .
ms. stark was adding mr. hajj â€™ s name to the apartment lease , the first step in removing her own .
desperate migrants were crossing into canada on foot .
sentiment was reshaping europe â€™ s political map .
so were a. t. m. cards .
as he stared down month 13 , he felt overwhelmed and alarmed .
from the start of the budgeting appointment , the settlement counselor , roula ajib , knew something was wrong .
worry , he replied .
his wife , 37 , protested the waste of money and told him to be patient .
their children were attending school for the first time in their lives , learning english and french , becoming ice skaters and soccer champions .
â€œ they won â€™ t leave us .
â€ but she knew her husband was despairing .
now she was initiating the hajj children in the sport , outfitting them with gear and taking them to a weekly class while their parents stayed home .
â€œ oh my god , it â€™ s like he â€™ s running on the ice , â€ ms. atkins exclaimed to jan dowler , the sponsor by her side .
should they stand back and stop acting as chauffeurs , planners and fixers ?
the skating lessons were only the beginning .
a calendar on the fridge indicated more reasons for showing up , like dental visits , noted with a tiny sketch of a tooth .
a doctor they had found for the family and a adviser warned them that they were impeding the hajjes from becoming .
they could not bear the thought of the family becoming isolated , the parents marginalized , the children missing out on activities their own children had taken for granted .
they asked the hajj parents to take the children to swimming lessons instead of doing it themselves .
but they rarely followed through .
when the hajj children missed a swimming lesson , the sponsors started taking them again .
â€œ i â€™ m not taking the bus .
â€ â€œ i haven â€™ t really fostered any independence , â€ she admitted .
even ms. dowler , who pushed the group to do less , found herself signing up the children for camp over spring break and trying to nab a gardening plot for mr. hajj , who missed farming .
some of the syrians took what the canadians felt were the wrong jobs , or signed up for too many credit cards .
others bought cars , even if they did not have driver â€™ s licenses .
the lowest point in the hajj sponsors â€™ year had started with an unsettling discovery .
like other syrians , mouhamad had arrived in canada eager to work , but had been counseled by the sponsors to instead take intensive english classes .
mr. hajj , who seemed evasive , said he had taken out the money to stock up on food .
when that turned up no evidence of theft , she and the other sponsors wondered if there were other explanations for the unfamiliar pattern .
had mr. hajj sent the money to his father in syria ?
stashed it away in a drawer ?
he had heard about it from his classmates in english lessons .
some were enrolling , seeing it as a safer bet than insecure , jobs , they told him .
some canadians argued that welfare was a necessary step for some refugees , buying them more time to learn the language , which would lead to better jobs in the long term .
in europe , the idea that government is taking services away from citizens and giving them to foreigners has become a familiar complaint .
in reply to his question about welfare , ms. karas did not mince words .
she explained that social assistance was a stopgap measure for people in need .
â€ mr. hajj agreed not to apply .
â€œ they must know for sure what is right and what is wrong .
when he and his family encountered extra expenses , they would have several thousand dollars waiting .
â€œ taxi !
if it happened again , ms. atkins told him , he should take the bus to yorkdale .
she spoke it slowly , syllable by syllable , and told him to practice .
â€œ yorkdale ! â€ the hajj children chimed in chorus with their father .
three weeks later , peggy karas stood in the hajjes â€™ living room and reached her arms out to julia , the .
jan. carole .
cliff .
marg .
but the hajjes were also showing small new signs of independence .
classmates of the couple â€™ s twins had started visiting for playdates .
50 .
as his english inched forward , his talk of going back to syria subsided .
according to early government figures , about half of privately sponsored adults were working full or part time .
as a group , they were outpacing the thousands more refugees who did not have sponsors and were being resettled by the government â€” only about 10 percent of them had jobs ( on the whole , they were less educated and had higher rates of serious health problems and other needs ) .
â€œ so mouhamad and i and the kids are always praying for them .
in the school parking lot , ms. karas pushed the stroller and carole atkins turned up with the older children , whom she had collected after school .
the twins â€™ teacher was stefanie apostol , a romanian immigrant who taught a special program for students who lacked formal schooling .
she had a lingering accent , a commanding presence and a habit of calling zahiya and her twin brother , majed , â€œ my kids .
zahiya was meticulous .
majed was fast .
the teacher , grasping the depth of his fear , decided to show him proof .
â€œ the chick did a trick with a brick , â€ zahiya followed , more hesitant .
the teacher turned to the sponsors .
there was extensive coverage of the health care vote , for example , but there was also considerable time given to topics , like a rape case in maryland , that viewers would not have heard about if they had turned to cnn or msnbc .
during coverage of the london terrorist attack , in a break from the rather muted coverage on cnn , â€œ fox and friends â€ veered into discussing the faith of the â€œ muslim mayor â€ of london .
still , while people who do not watch fox news may think it presents a uniform voice from morning to night , the network â€™ s content varies plenty .
â€œ it â€™ s like she â€™ s looking at us , â€ added mr. kilmeade of the cover photo .
â€œ fox and friends â€ did not note that .
_________ as the day progressed , more time was given to covering the health care bill .
â€ ms. guilfoyle deemed it a â€œ shameful blackout .
â€ a guest on â€œ america â€™ s newsroom , â€ ed martin , bluntly stated that â€œ they â€™ re raping and killing our people , and that â€™ s what trump won on .
for instance , fox showed all 50 minutes of sean spicer â€™ s white house press briefing , just as cnn and msnbc did .
mr. hunter argued that the bill would â€œ save america .
â€ eric bolling , who was filling in for the host , bill o â€™ reilly , did not raise the investigation with the congressman .
â€ earlier , on â€œ america â€™ s newsroom , â€ mr. henry was quick to draw a comparison with mr. trump â€™ s predecessor .
a list of the guests who appeared on the network on thursday includes mr. spicer , jerry falwell jr. the former arkansas governor mike huckabee and the british politician nigel farage .
â€œ i should think he â€™ s pleased that he has been proved to be right .
as the night wore down , and in the aftermath of the delayed health care vote , mr. hannity turned his attention fully to this latest topic .
so she had been able to watch as dr. ilyas first sliced into her swollen right wrist , tugged gently at skin flaps , and then opened a small bloody crater , exposing the inflamed sheath that had trapped her tendons .
as he scraped , dr. ilyas chatted with ms. voynow , trying to keep her calm .
patients can become unnerved by a seemingly ominous silence , or put off by what passes for office humor .
â€ as a to staff members , some hospitals now post warning signs on the o. r. door : patient awake .
the occasional scandals that emerge while patients are sedated continue to erode their trust in us .
â€ but patients are also intrigued by what is being done to them while they are asleep .
in choosing to stay awake , added dr. langerman , â€œ there â€™ s a curiosity and desire to have control over your experience .
â€ indeed , a few studies suggest that some patients feel less anxious about staying awake during surgery , despite possible gruesome sights , than they do about being sedated .
orthopedics is the chief specialty for such procedures , but surgery in breast , colorectal , thoracic , vascular , otolaryngological , urological , ophthalmological and cosmetic specialties is also moving in this direction .
recovery time is swifter and side effects are fewer , which can reduce the need for postoperative opioids .
proponents like dr. ilyas , who operates at the rothman orthopaedic specialty hospital in bensalem , praise awake surgery as a step forward in transparency .
what happens if the patient becomes too anxious ?
or objects vigorously when a trainee scrubs in â€” a mainstay of surgical education ?
â€œ they often have a fear of litigation , or a fear of disappointing the patient .
during his awake colonoscopy , he discussed with the gastroenterologist .
â€œ they have to cut the capsule of the knee , which is quite thick .
then they hammer , and it sends a shock wave slamming into your knee .
it doesn â€™ t hurt , but you feel the pressure .
and you smell burning flesh .
( related : a reporter watches her own knee surgery . )
â€œ it â€™ s people at work , doing their job .
â€œ they don â€™ t teach that in medical school .
â€œ the patient will keep asking , â€˜ what is my heart doing ?
is that beep normal ?
he also keeps on hand headphones , music selections and video glasses to soothe anxious awake patients .
rather than risk unsettling the patient with what might be a typical instruction to a resident â€” â€œ see if you can find your way through it â€ â€” dr. marin may be more circumspect : â€œ we need to adjust this piece over here .
â€œ they want to know you are confident , focused and in control .
i â€™ d rather be asleep .

2047,19578 , '' amazon â€™ s ambitions unboxed : stores for furniture , appliances and more - the new york times '' , new york times , nick wingfield,2017-06-16,2017.0,6.0 , , '' seattle â€” last sunday in palm springs , calif. jeffrey p. bezos , the chief executive of amazon , climbed into the cockpit of a robot and began flailing his arms as though warming up for a workout , causing the robot â€™ s enormous appendages to mimic his movements .
â€ the intimate audience of entrepreneurs and academics , attending an amazon conference on robotics and artificial intelligence , chuckled .
over time , they could also introduce new forms of automation , putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy .
amazon is also kicking around an concept similar to apple â€™ s retail emporiums , according to two of the people familiar with the discussions .
these shops would have a heavy emphasis on amazon devices and services such as the company â€™ s echo smart home speaker and prime video streaming service .
last week , amazon opened its fifth physical book store in chicago , and it has five more announced locations under construction .
amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly .
â€ despite amazon â€™ s internet retailing success , over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person .
the most glaring example is groceries â€” the mother of all shopping categories , with about $ 770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the food marketing institute , a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the united states .
â€ amazon â€™ s current market value is bobbing around $ 400 billion .
recently , as cars ripped by , workers hung a sign on the exterior of one of the stores â€” to be called amazonfresh pickup , according to city permit documents obtained by geekwire â€” before quickly covering it up .
amazon previously said it would open amazon go to the public in early 2017 .
more than 3 .
4 million people are employed as cashiers in the united states , according to the bureau of labor statistics .
1 topic of conversation is amazon .
â€ but a group within amazon has explored another larger grocery store format , according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal amazon documents reviewed by the new york times .
the company , which has vowed to spend billions of dollars on its efforts in the world â€™ s populous country , recently sought approval from the indian government to open online and physical food stores in the country , the economic times reported in february .
for mr. galloway at n. y. u. the slow pace of amazon â€™ s rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet , and that has surprised him .

but this was a murphy â€™ s law game for kansas .
from oregon â€™ s hot hand to jackson â€™ s foul trouble to devonte â€™ graham â€™ s shooting â€” graham , a junior who was nearly 4 for 10 from range over the season , was a stunning 0 for 7 from the field and missed all six of his attempts â€” nearly everything that could go amiss did .
even when a tight â€” almost nervous â€” oregon offense let them back in the game , kansas could not convert on the opportunity .
the jayhawks appeared to be poised for their 15th trip to the final four and a chance to win the tournament a fourth time .
â€œ they were the aggressor and certainly controlled the game almost from the jump , â€ kansas coach bill self said .
oregon , however , was not about to be beaten in a track meet .
especially not with phil knight , the oregon present .
â€œ they like to play fast , we like to play fast , too .
it was that kind of game for oregon .
kansas , undeterred , climbed back into the game .
the jayhawks cut the margin to with less than three minutes left .

in recent months , the provinces in the kasai region , in congo , have been the scene of fighting between the police and a local tribal militia called kamuina nsapu .
the central region of the country is particularly volatile because of an insurgency , with frequent clashes between militia fighters and the military and security forces , despite the presence of united nations peacekeepers .
civilians are often caught up in the violence .
last week , the congolese military â€™ s auditor general announced that seven officers had been arrested and charged with war crimes after a video surfaced last month depicting soldiers shooting a group of civilians in province , a massacre that left at least 13 dead .
amid the mounting accusations of violence against civilians , and the discovery of 10 mass graves dug in january and february in the chief of the united nations peacekeeping mission in congo urged the united nations security council this week to press the government to open an investigation into possible human rights violations .
some elected leaders and human rights advocates in congo have called for an independent international inquiry .
some insurgents , however , are reportedly surrendering to the authorities .
but as he spoke inside the capitol , a committee colleague , representative jim himes , democrat of connecticut , peered into a different camera , belonging to cnn , a few feet to the left .
of greater concern in the intelligence sphere is his recent burst of media exposure , with a public speaking style that can at times seem cavalier while discussing sensitive information .
â€œ because as you know , he â€™ s taking a lot of heat in the news media .
â€ it was not always thus .
mr. nunes also announced the cancellation of a public meeting with former intelligence and law enforcement leaders , citing a desire to bring in james b. comey , the f. b. i. director , and michael s. rogers , the head of the national security agency , for a closed session instead .
both testified before the committee this week .
and in a sign of how far their relationship has fallen , mr. schiff â€” who for weeks stood by mr. nunes â€™ s side before reporters and defended him â€” accused him of taking that action because the white house had told him to .
presiding over a committee hearing on monday â€” when mr. comey took the extraordinary step of announcing the agency â€™ s investigation into whether the trump campaign had colluded with russia to influence the 2016 election â€” mr. nunes mustered deeper alarm over anonymous sources revealing an inquiry â€™ s details to journalists than over the contents of the investigation .
it has also not always been entirely clear what mr. nunes is talking about .
heads snapped up from their phones and notepads .
â€œ excuse me , let me just clarify , â€ another reporter began .

he was also found not guilty of two felony charges , for his handling of allegations against jerry sandusky , a former assistant coach .
in 2013 , penn state agreed to pay $ 59 .
7 million to 26 sexual abuse victims in exchange for an end to their claims against the university .
the extent and nature of the abuse shocked the state college , pa. community , upended a university that has long adored its vaunted football program and badly tarnished the reputation of the beloved head coach , joe paterno , who was among those suspected of turning a blind eye to his assistant â€™ s conduct .
mr. paterno , an icon on campus and the most victorious coach in major college football , was dismissed , and died soon after .
much of his coaching staff was dismissed .
but the cases against mr. spanier , mr. curley and mr. schultz , brought after she was elected , sputtered after legal delays , and some of the charges were dropped .
ultimately , the proceedings against the three men outlasted ms. kane , who fell from power in her own scandal , convicted of perjury and abuse of her office .
and the criminal charges that resulted , not just against the attacker but against administrators accused of covering up his crimes , have no parallel in recent memory .
the count on which mr. spanier was convicted was charged as a felony , but the jury instead chose to convict him of the misdemeanor version of it .
the jury acquitted him of another felony count of child endangerment , and a charge of conspiracy , also a felony .
â€ children â€™ s advocates called the administrators â€™ convictions a victory for accountability .
supporters of mr. spanier and mr. paterno held up the acquittal on the conspiracy charge as vindication .
â€ mr. spanier sued the university , accusing it of violating their separation agreement .
the university countersued , seeking to recoup more than $ 5 million it has paid him .
â€ prosecution witnesses included mike mcqueary , a former assistant coach who testified that he had told mr. paterno , mr. curley and mr. schultz that he had seen mr. sandusky molesting the boy in the shower .
mr. spanier â€™ s lawyers called no witnesses in his defense , but , according to news media reports , told the jury that prosecutors had failed to provide evidence that he knew mr. sandusky was accused of sexual abuse .
the pipeline would link oil producers in canada and north dakota with refiners and export terminals on the gulf coast .
it needs the approval of the nebraska public service commission and local landowners who are concerned about their water and land rights .
protests are likely since the project has become an important symbol for the environmental movement , with the canadian oil sands among the most oil supplies .
mining the oil sands requires vast amounts of energy for extraction and processing .
in addition , interest among many oil companies in the oil sands is waning amid sluggish oil prices .
extraction from the oil sands , situated in the boreal forest , is expensive .
in recent weeks , royal dutch shell agreed to sell most of its oil sands assets for $ 8 .
5 billion .
5 billion barrels of reserves , conceding the oil sands were not economically attractive enough to develop for the next few years at least .
and the keystone effort is central to the future of transcanada , a major force in the canadian oil patch .
most of the refined product would probably be exported , or it might enable domestic producers to export more oil produced in texas , louisiana and oklahoma .
when the project was in the planning stages , the united states was highly dependent on oil from the middle east .
but in recent years , domestic production has nearly doubled , and the united states now exports increasing amounts of oil and natural gas .
the pipeline would most likely raise the price of canadian oil , which is now even more depressed than other international grades .
proponents have argued that rail or truck transport is more polluting and dangerous than pipelines .
the uber vehicle , which had a person in the driver â€™ s seat but was in mode , was not at fault in the accident , according to josie montenegro , a tempe police department spokeswoman .
google , general motors and ford motor company are all testing autonomous vehicles in california and have registered to do so .
the car was driving itself at the time , according to internal documents reviewed by the times .
after the california department of motor vehicles revoked the registrations for uber â€™ s cars , the company took its vehicles to arizona for testing , where the governor did not require the company to seek autonomous testing permits .
google , which has long tested vehicles in california , has also been in a number of accidents over the years .
below are some additional edited excerpts from our hours of conversation .
â€œ your no .
for me , when i was at my most popular , i maligned myself .
it â€™ s a very interesting thing because if , when you mellow out in your life , it â€™ s the wrong time .
..
i think a lot of people â€™ s last impression of me is outdated .
i actually really do .
â€ â€œ my brother just had a baby .
that â€™ ll rattle you , man .
the oxytocin flows freely in my brain when i see that stuff .
it â€™ s just the life that i have , which is fabulous â€” it â€™ s just a bit more time on the international space station .
don â€™ t ever let me give you the sense that i don â€™ t love being on the international space station .
i â€™ ve never hated it .
they don â€™ t .
â€™ â€ â€œ â€˜ your body is a wonderland â€™ lives so much in its own atmosphere that it â€™ s like it â€™ s been handed to me by some other person .
dave chappelle has rick james , you know ? â€ â€œ we live in a time right now where the message will be judged against the messenger .
it didn â€™ t matter who you were .
the thing i told myself , which is so healthy â€” so please don â€™ t tell me that i â€™ m wrong â€” was : â€˜ she doesn â€™ t care about me. â€™ it â€™ s not my job to win them all over .
you can not feel inclusion .
you can not feel being under a wing .
i was just there as a piece of their puzzle .
â€ ''
â€ what books are on your night stand now ?
it â€™ s too stimulating .
watch tv instead .
it â€™ s boring .
â€ and it â€™ s true .
so now instead of being overstimulated and awake , i â€™ m bored and awake .
except for rereading , which i â€™ ve been doing a lot .
especially john o â€™ hara .
this really kind of stumped me .
i know you â€™ re not supposed to have this kind of hierarchy of books .
but i do .
â€œ little dorrit .
except for â€œ martin chuzzlewit , â€ which i loved .
but now , as of last summer , everyone is reading henry green .
i suppose other people like it and have heard of it , but i assume it is obscure enough for this answer .
this is something i usually avoid answering , because you always leave someone out .
toni morrison , deborah eisenberg , lynne tillman , wallace shawn , junot dÃ­az , ben katchor and cynthia ozick .
whose opinion on books do you most trust ?
mine .
when do you read ?
pretty much all the time .
i was very frequently punished for reading as a child because i was reading when i was supposed to be doing homework .
so it â€™ s really rare that reading is unaccompanied by guilt for me .
i feel guilty pretty much all the time .
the only time i read without feeling guilty is on a plane , because what else could i possibly be doing ?
i don â€™ t really seek out emotion when reading .
i just want to be taken away .
i really like being dazzled .
that may have to do with being older .
without reading , you â€™ re stuck with life .
which genres do you especially enjoy reading ?
and which do you avoid ?
this is not because i care about who did it .
i don â€™ t care .
i don â€™ t have that kind of mind at all .
i don â€™ t care who did it .
i have reread mysteries numerous times and i don â€™ t even remember who did it .
i â€™ ve read all the agatha christies .
i â€™ ve read all the nero wolfe books by rex stout .
i have avoided science fiction my entire life , or any kind of fantasy .
but i didn â€™ t like it .
to see children lined up outside bookstores â€” that was fantastic .
but those kinds of books .
.
â€™ u2008 .
â€™ u2008 .
how do you like to read ?
paper or electronic ?
obviously , paper .
i mean , actually , on his show once , jimmy fallon gave me a kindle .
a bentley .
â€ i don â€™ t think they â€™ re horrible .
i don â€™ t object to them .
i â€™ d rather squint .
it seems to me that the majority of people you see reading on these things are in their 40s .
i see fewer kids reading on them , and by kids i mean people in their 20s .
how do you organize your books ?
those kinds of categories .
then within categories , they â€™ re alphabetized .
you have to have them arranged by writer .
but that would take up too much space .
â€ all the apartments i buy or rent are for my books , not for myself .
i don â€™ t need the space .
i â€™ m .
i have a whole bookcase that this guy calls â€œ your crazy books .
â€ the crazy book category .
those books are not alphabetized .
i actually bought myself the encyclopaedia britannica in 1978 .
i always wanted it , and when i wrote my first book and had some money , i bought it .
the encyclopaedia britannica was so hard to buy , i can â€™ t tell you .
it was like $ 10 , 000 .
i had a friend who owned a bookstore , and i begged her to let me buy it at cost , and she did .
it was still several thousand dollars , but i â€™ m delighted to own it , even though i think it â€™ s now free on the internet .
what â€™ s that been like ?
because it â€™ s so awful , i keep putting it off .
that takes three days .
they are mostly .
i like to have fiction in the living room , reference books in the writing room .
i have 10 , 000 books .
and unbidden books , i don â€™ t want to keep them .
once the books are all rearranged , i can put my hand on any book .
i know where they all are .
i don â€™ t know .
maybe my small library of soap carving books , because most people don â€™ t have them .
but i like to eat , and i like to read about food .
the very first book in my library was a book my mother bought me at a house sale in the late 1950s called â€œ six little cooks .
â€ she bought it for a quarter .
it â€™ s signed by the author and all the girls .
i don â€™ t know .
i â€™ ve received some really wonderful books as gifts .
i would never buy these books .
i buy books to read .
it adds about 80 zillion dollars to the price of a book to have a signed or first edition .
i couldn â€™ t contain myself .
who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine ?
your favorite antihero or villain ?
i don â€™ t really have these kinds of favorites .
i probably had them as a child .
i associate having favorite things with being a child .
i â€™ m not youthful enough to have these kinds of favorites .
what kind of reader were you as a child ?
which childhood books and authors stick with you most ?
i was a constant reader .
just like i am now .
i was constantly reading .
i read under the covers with a flashlight .
i loved â€œ the secret garden .
i also have a lot of my mother â€™ s books .
â€œ heidi , â€ nancy drew .
which three writers , dead or alive , do you invite ?
none .
when i eat alone , i spend a lot of time , before i sit down to my meager meal , choosing what to read .
ever .
if i â€™ m eating an apple , i have to get a book .
do you remember the last book you put down without finishing ?
i don â€™ t enjoy reading him .
i did not acquire the ability to not finish a book until i was 50 years old , which probably has to do with scarcity as a child : you have a book â€” finish it !
if you don â€™ t like a book , stop reading it .
if you don â€™ t like a movie , walk out .
life is not a jail sentence .
i only read for pleasure .
i don â€™ t have to finish a book .
sometimes , i don â€™ t realize how little i care about a book .
sometimes , i start reading a book and then realize i forgot i was reading it .
and it disappears under a pile of books .
all women my age loved nancy drew books .
it was pretty uncommon .
i really don â€™ t .
people are so organized !
this is a cast of mind so different from mine .
i do have piles of books that i haven â€™ t read yet .
it â€™ s just not for fran .
i typed as the prosecutor laid out the details of the case .
they were each .
they owned a farm outside town .
he took her home , forced her onto their bed , hit her and began to squeeze her neck .
he might have choked her to death .
then it was time for the wife to speak .
he was religious and hardworking .
we married and had three children very quickly .
i didn â€™ t want to keep washing dishes and doing housework forever .
it â€™ s a pleated blue skirt with a white shirt tucked in , the blue and white for the flag of nicaragua , with these long white socks up to the knee .
sometimes my breasts filled up and leaked through my uniform .
i didn â€™ t care .
but my husband did .
he didn â€™ t want me to go back to school .
he began to treat me badly .
but i couldn â€™ t leave .
too bad , i told myself .
i â€™ ll just have to endure it .
other times he got my uniform dirty or tore up my notebooks .
i would buy new ones and copy my assignments all over again .
i heard that the courthouse was looking for someone to mop the floors and clean the shutters .
i wasn â€™ t even an official employee .
the judges paid me 300 cÃ³rdobas a month ( about $ 20 at the time ) out of their own salaries .
my husband was furious about it .
â€œ i want to be something .
then i began to clean a second courthouse , so that was 600 cÃ³rdobas a month .
some time later , my boss , a woman , encouraged me to study law .
it was only after i became a lawyer several years ago that i started earning enough money to support myself and my kids on my own .
finally i didn â€™ t have to put up with this man anymore .
so i divorced him .
â€ the essay , titled â€œ thanksgiving in mongolia , â€ was a brutal read .
â€ and yet .
not only did she lose her child , but her marriage also fell apart .
this felt like a karmic smackdown , and ms. levy wanted to interrogate her own responsibility for such a sequence of grim events .
there is no child .
â€ ms. levy bought the apartment during her marriage , when she and her former spouse , now a recovering alcoholic , separated for a time .
â€œ this thinking that you can have every single thing you want in life is not the thinking of a feminist , â€ ms. levy told the audience that night .
â€œ it â€™ s the thinking of a toddler .
hashtag toddler .
she has a gothic affair with a brutish and unhinged transgender man who hacks ms. levy â€™ s computer .
when ms. levy conceives a child with the sperm of a dear friend who is rich enough to pay the child â€™ s college tuition but wants a relationship to parenthood , you imagine a sort of michael cunningham utopia for ms. levy and her wife in their house on shelter island .
or perhaps a reality show .
simon doonan and jonathan adler , colorful exemplars not just of marriage but also of manhattan â€™ s creative class , are their neighbors .
other times , they were aghast to recognize their own entitlement , staring back at them magnified in the mirror of their offspring .
â€ ms. levy , who in person speaks in the vernacular of her era â€” â€œ dude â€ and â€œ girl â€ are her preferred terms of address â€” presents a memoir often festooned with irony .
it â€™ s her second book .
â€œ female chauvinist pigs , â€ out in 2005 , wondered just how liberated the heroines of â€œ raunch â€ culture actually were .
she wears her sensibility lightly .
â€œ people didn â€™ t like me , i was loud and aggressive .
last week , ms. levy profiled the photographer catherine opie , once an sm aficionado and darling of the whitney biennial , circa 1995 , unpacking her homey radicalism .
â€ she added : â€œ i think it would be difficult to argue that i â€™ m a for womenkind .
i don â€™ t know that i â€™ m the problem .
â€œ she â€™ s uniquely intrepid .
people tend to see things through the lens of victimhood , but ari takes full responsibility and carries on .
what i did know about was something being amiss in the house , there being a secret , and knowing â€” knowing â€” something â€™ s off .
you â€™ re done .
â€ she added : â€œ it â€™ s not that i have no regrets , but i no longer think , for example , i shouldn â€™ t have gone to mongolia .
it wouldn â€™ t have mattered .
my illness .
my divorce .
my delight .
they are everywhere .
â€ she is a joyful person , and a joyful writer , he added .
ari ain â€™ t recessive .
when her marriage finally ends , ms. levy strikes up a correspondence with the handsome south african doctor john gasson , who had treated her in mongolia .
the memoir ends ambiguously , with ms. levy pondering a flight to south africa .
let it go .
â€ she and dr. gasson , a rotational doctor whose work schedule at a clinic in nigeria is five weeks on , five weeks off and who also writes , are engaged .
as to where they will live , she added , â€œ we â€™ re going to be mobile .
or as ms. dunham put it , ms. levy â€œ fully is like hitting it with the hot doctor in the book .

the grand plans of lower rates , fewer loopholes and a tax on imports may have to be scaled back to a big corporate tax cut and possibly an individual tax cut .
â€ because of the arcane rules of lawmaking in congress , there may be little choice .
because they failed , republicans will struggle to reach their goal of cutting corporate tax rates without piling on debt .
â€œ does it have to be fully offset ?
mr. ryan and mr. brady are unlikely to simply hand over tax policy to the white house .
â€ ''
2062,19595 , '' democrats , buoyed by g.o.p .
while it is far too soon to suggest that the house republican majority may be imperiled , democrats are newly optimistic about picking up seats in 2018 , hoping to ride a backlash against mr. trump .
â€ of course , much of the story revolves around the inability of the fractured republican majority to reach a consensus .
some democratic senators are uneasy about rejecting judge gorsuch , preferring to save any fight for an opportunity by mr. trump to fill a seat now held by a liberal justice .
but the party â€™ s senators may now be pressed to take a more aggressive posture against mr. gorsuch , opposition that may not halt his confirmation but would force senate republicans to eliminate the filibuster for such nominations .
president george w. bush sought to overhaul a program covering millions of americans but suffered a crippling loss when democrats put up uniform opposition and republicans backed away in fear of enduring political consequences .
in the house , democrats need 24 seats to take back the chamber .
the vote to fill the suburban atlanta seat vacated by the new health secretary , tom price , will take place on april 18 , and the republicans running are as splintered over how best to confront the affordable care act as their counterparts are in washington .
with democrats rallying around a candidate , jon ossoff , and the large field of republicans splitting the vote , some republican strategists are concerned that mr. ossoff may avoid a runoff by winning 50 percent of the vote .
â€ for now , though , democrats stand to gain simply by standing back and abiding by the maxim of not getting in the way of an opponent who is damaging himself .
mr. obama provided conservatives with not just a health law to loathe and a veto pen to blame , but also a visage that allowed their opposition to be more palpable .
â€œ there â€™ s this disjunction , â€ mr. lowry added .
he doesn â€™ t even really have a wing of a congressional party .
there were dissenters among the more conservative lawmakers , those representing suburban communities outside philadelphia and washington and rural states like louisiana .
â€œ they wanted more health care for themselves , less immigration and no more bushes .
obviously , that was very , very popular .
â€œ but if he can talk about labor rate participation , jobs , jobs that are paying more , that â€™ s what he â€™ ll be judged on .
â€ ''
it is a major departure from historic norm and degradation of the office .
â€œ i think our brand is the hottest it has ever been .
.
â€œ thank you , donald !
s. a. !
u. s. a .
! â€ a few minutes later , mr. trump disappeared into his motorcade for the short ride home . ''
that appeal was echoed by senator susan collins of maine , a moderate republican who opposed the house republicans â€™ health bill and has also worked with democrats to explore changes to the affordable care act without repealing it .
â€œ until there was a repudiation of the house bill , they felt constrained from negotiating .
â€ representative don young , republican of alaska , also called for bipartisanship .
democrats also sounded more conciliatory .
i hope republicans are willing to do that , instead of just destroying obamacare .
â€ but , he added , â€œ before we can work with them , the republicans have to bargain in good faith and stop sabotaging obamacare .
within a few weeks , insurers must decide whether they will participate in the marketplaces in 2018 .
gov , under mr. obama .
under the affordable care act , insurers can charge older adults no more than three times the rates for young adults .
the possibility of bipartisan cooperation may not last long .
in their phone call on saturday , according to a person briefed on the matter , mr. ryan told mr. trump that he wanted to proceed with a tax overhaul package .
congressional republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like facebook and google .
they also assert , more broadly , that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation .
states have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory .
mr. hastings said lobbyists representing companies including microsoft , apple , lyft and amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill .
illinois also has another dimension : lawyers .
this has given rise to a series of potentially expensive lawsuits against facebook , google and others .

the protest in the capital took the form of a synchronized walk along a major shopping street to avoid a ban on unsanctioned stationary gatherings .
in moscow , some protesters tried to block security vans with cars , and the authorities deployed the riot police and surveillance helicopters .
the united states government can not be silent about russia â€™ s crackdown on peaceful protesters .
protesters tried to prevent a police van from taking mr. navalny away and chanted : â€œ this is our city .
this is our city .
walk along tverskaya .
others carried easily hidden signs featuring pictures of ducks , a reference to a claim by mr. navalny that corrupt officials even build houses for their ducks .
mr. navalny called for the protests after russia â€™ s parliament , which is dominated by united russia â€” a political party loyal to mr. putin â€” ignored demands for an investigation into accusations of corruption by senior government officials .
the guests included the â€™ s chief white house strategist , stephen k. bannon his and family consigliere , jared kushner his chief of staff , reince priebus his economic adviser , gary cohn his nominee for treasury secretary , steven mnuchin his incoming deputy chief of staff , rick dearborn and his director , marc short .
â€œ i think the democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs , because they â€™ re too consumed by identity politics .
and then the republicans , it â€™ s all this theoretical cato institute , austrian economics , limited government â€” which just doesn â€™ t have any depth to it .
â€ breitbart news , the media outlet bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the trump campaign in august , had described ryan , referring to his position on immigration , as â€œ arguably the most g. o. p. lawmaker in congress â€ â€” an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from bannon â€™ s perspective .
but as the dinner progressed , it became clear that bannon and ryan actually had some ideas in common .
it also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax .
now they had bannon â€™ s attention .
bannon laughed .
â€ he meant it as a compliment .
compared with bannon â€™ s revolutionary fervor , his reply was surprisingly cautious .
â€œ i don â€™ t see â€˜ nationalism â€™ as a bad word .
i see it as a very positive word .
it doesn â€™ t mean we won â€™ t trade with other countries .
â€ trump â€™ s tone was genial but also a touch defensive .
â€ but by march , this timetable was looking like a formidable â€œ if .
â€ during the call , i could hear priebus nearby , occasionally murmuring encouragement .
in congress , he was grappling with an arcane and famously inefficient ecosystem over which he had little if any control â€” and people he incessantly derided on the campaign trail as being â€œ all talk and no action .
we â€™ ve done a lot .
i think we â€™ ve done more than anybody for this short period of time .
â€ abraham lincoln , franklin roosevelt and lyndon johnson would take exception to this claim .
at this stage of his presidency , barack obama had already signed into law his $ 787 billion package and had moved on to holding white house meetings on health care .
on the hill , he has a few random associations â€” senator rand paul of kentucky and representative john culberson of texas among them .
the only certainty was that the report would urge republicans to court the growing latino electorate â€” which had voted for obama by a margin that november â€” by championing comprehensive immigration reform .
the three men at the dinner table that night were among the few republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion .
â€ trende observed that obama â€™ s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6 .
6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012 .
their jobs , their raises , their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built china .
because china â€™ s really built on investments and exports , right ?
it â€™ s linked to their lives .
â€ palin demurred .
she was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth , she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by bannon â€™ s warning that she stood little chance of defeating obama .
trade is no .
1 .
immigration is no .
10 .
2 .
â€œ it was pretty obvious by the end of the night , â€ bannon recalled , â€œ that another candidate would have to do it .
â€ two months later , on march 15 , 2013 , bannon happened to be attending the conservative political action conference in washington when trump took the stage .
but trump â€™ s grousing references to china â€™ s economic superiority , to 11 million â€œ illegals â€ and to the erosion of america â€™ s manufacturing sector were right out of bannon â€™ s playbook .
he didn â€™ t want to be seen as .
after the dinner , bannon and conway huddled with the candidate .
the last time the republican party controlled all branches of government in washington was from 2003 to 2007 .
when mccarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in bakersfield , calif. in the late 1980s , his girlfriend at the time , now his wife , judy , gave him an autographed copy of trump â€™ s â€œ the art of the deal .
in mccarthy â€™ s view , trump is a master of today â€™ s media , much as lincoln and kennedy were in their own times .
â€œ it â€™ s like owning newspapers .
and mccarthy â€™ s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest .
some of the others , too .
i don â€™ t think we â€™ ll need to .
i think they â€™ re very positive .
â€ trump â€™ s budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious , because it does not touch entitlements .
and a bill that cuts all money for the n. e. a. will not pass .
and that â€™ ll happen .
but in so doing , they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to republicans .
i â€™ m the king of that .
of course , bannon has openly advocated abandoning the w. t. o. anyway , because of china â€™ s membership in it .
â€ perhaps the republican faction most alarmed by bannon â€™ s economic nationalism is washington â€™ s military hawks .
it â€™ s a shell game , my friend .
â€œ we discuss issues all the time .
so it â€™ s almost a schizophrenic â€” that â€™ s not the right word .
paradoxical .
please .
among them were heidi heitkamp , joe donnelly of indiana , joe manchin of west virginia and jon tester of montana .
if democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the senate majority , they will need to hold these four seats .
republicans enjoy a precarious advantage in the senate .
but donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a â€œ .
he was charming but also brash .
says former representative ben chandler of kentucky , who was also in attendance : â€œ the difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark .
you can tell people you care .
but it matters if you show up .
before the meeting , bannon took the west virginia senator aside .
within an hour after manchin was offscreen , his cellphone rang .
( the metropolitan transportation authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel . )
so it â€™ s not just a political piece of paper .
â€ what also may not happen is house republicans â€™ supporting a bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago .
it â€™ s also possible that even moderate democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to trump â€™ s rescue .
â€˜ i can â€™ t. â€™ why not ?
amid this chaos â€” entirely to bannon â€™ s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in washington â€” actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding .
trump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors .
â€œ they were a bit surprised , â€ neal later told me .
he was also struck by the white house â€™ s abhorrence of multilateral pacts , which seemed to him to be naÃ¯ve .
â€ neal â€™ s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of trump and bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric .
of all the legislative lifts , none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements , which require a simple majority approval by both the senate and the house .
scrounging up 15 democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue .
smoot and mr. hawley are smiling .
â€ on thursday , march 23 , trump hosted a morning meeting of freedom caucus holdouts in the cabinet room .
we need to put up a win .
it â€™ s not just about needing to repeal obamacare â€” though we do .
the white house was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing .
it wasn â€™ t enough .
nine months seemed like a long time then , the calendar spacious and the legislative possibilities plentiful .
when he took office , trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the white house .
by the time i spoke with him in early march , however , he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers .
â€œ some more than others .

2070,19604 , who killed the iceman ?
clues emerge in a very cold case - the new york times , new york times , rod nordland,2017-03-31,2017.0,3.0 , , '' bolzano , italy â€” when the head of a small italian museum called detective inspector alexander horn of the munich police , she asked him if he investigated cold cases .
the unknown victim , nicknamed Ã¶tzi , has literally been in cold storage in her museum for a .
most were ritually prepared , which usually meant removal of internal organs , preservation with chemicals or exposure to destructive desert conditions .
the glacier not only froze Ã¶tzi where he had died , but the high humidity of the ice also kept his organs and skin largely intact .
â€œ in a lot of cases we are not able to do that even now .
he was 5 feet 5 inches tall ( about average height for his time ) weighed 110 pounds , had brown eyes and dark brown hair , and a size 7Â½ foot .
when viewed through the window of the museum â€™ s freezer , where he is kept now , his hands not only appear unusually small , but they also show little sign of hard use , suggesting that Ã¶tzi was no manual laborer .
from examining traces of pollen in his digestive tract , scientists were able to place the date of Ã¶tzi â€™ s death at sometime in late spring or early summer .
from this , inspector horn surmises that Ã¶tzi may have come down to his village and become embroiled in a violent altercation .
then he left , fully provisioned with food , the embers of a fire preserved in maple leaf wrappings inside a cylinder , and quite a lot of other equipment , most of it probably carried in a backpack with a wooden frame .
inspector horn reckons Ã¶tzi was in no hurry .
there is even evidence that some of his food was recently cooked .
Ã¶tzi â€™ s longbow was only half a day â€™ s work from completion , he added , but there was no sign that he was working on it at the time .
â€œ which is pretty much what you see all the time nowadays .
most homicides are personal , and follow violence and an escalation of violence .

on a recent morning here in spring training , before the start of his 12th full major league season , he was talking about how , at age 36 , he will handle the rigors of chasing down balls in center field .
as he talked , he asked for a brief timeout and reached for the water bottle he had left on the floor beside his locker .
granderson drinks by the sip .
he is also a firm believer in water , because he can â€™ t drink as much when the water is cold .
thus , a of bottles is always adjacent to his locker .
there â€™ s also expansive territory to cover in center field .
granderson may not be ideal as the mets â€™ primary player at that position , but he is the best option on a roster with numerous corner outfielders .
and despite an uneven 2016 season , when he hit .
237 , he clobbered 30 home runs , second only to yoenis cespedes on the mets , and drew a 74 walks .
since signing a $ 60 million deal with the mets before the 2014 season , granderson has primarily played in right .
granderson â€™ s recent track record is proof of how much care he puts into staying healthy .
â€ that mentality now applies to the too .
â€œ i like vegetables .
i like fruits .
i like fried stuff .
i like sweets .
often busy with charity work , granderson packs a lunch of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , nuts , fruit and chocolate milk .
during spring training , he often eats in the mets â€™ clubhouse .
â€œ i â€™ m like a baby in a car .
â€ but or regular season , the common thread for granderson is water , and then more water .
a routine sight in the mets â€™ clubhouse is granderson stuffing water bottles into his glove , back pockets or backpack before practice or when leaving for the team hotel .
granderson changed how much water he consumed after a game on may 1 , 2010 , when he was 29 and playing for the yankees .
â€œ there they told me : â€˜ man , even your veins are dehydrated .
but a lack of hydration has not been an issue .
â€ granderson now has his water consumption down to a science .
then he has 12 ounces with breakfast .
he carries three bottles out to batting practice with him .
his postgame protein shake is followed by another bottle of water on the way home , and then several more before he goes to sleep .
granderson also drinks decaffeinated tea but doesn â€™ t consume soda , juice or coffee .
those were pushed aside when his water consumption shot up .
but he is always looking to take another sip , amazing his teammates in the process .

the contestants were taken to a estate on the remote ardnamurchan peninsula on the west coast of scotland , which is known for its forests , lochs and beaches .
but â€œ eden â€ proved to be anything but paradise .
over time , all but 10 contestants quit the show , the press and journal of aberdeen , scotland , reported .
those who left cited concerns about health and safety , boredom and swarms of tiny biting insects called midges .
the series was filmed with a crew of four embedded with the contestants , who also had personal cameras .
a rig of 45 cameras , described by the radio times as a network of television cameras that could be controlled remotely , was also used .
it was intended to feature the making of a society from scratch .
the show followed the contestants , which included a doctor , a chef , a carpenter and a shepherd , as they debated their own rules and laws and decided on their living arrangements .
goats , sheep , pigs and chickens and equipment for fishing and hunting were supplied .
materials for building , cooking and safety and hygiene were also provided .
but for some , the primitive accommodations proved too much , and they took to getting food and liquor from the pockets of civilization that dot the region , according to news accounts .

2 seconds .
he opted to trust his players .
like nearly everyone else inside the building , williams turned into a mere spectator as theo pinson , a junior swingman , pushed the ball upcourt , into the teeth of kentucky â€™ s defense , before tossing the ball outside to the sophomore forward luke maye , who set his feet and released an jumper : swish .
maye â€™ s effortless shot with 0 .
a. tournament .
it was a wild ending to a thrilling game , a classic that the tar heels punctuated by snipping the nets in .
on a court cluttered with maye â€” an unsung reserve who averaged about 14 minutes of playing time during the regular season â€” stood apart in the closing seconds .
he had watched his players fend off every rally .
he knew they were capable of pushing the ball .
so he left them in charge .
the wildcats also labored with foul trouble throughout .
coach john calipari was not pleased with the officiating .
amazing that we had a chance .
and not just any player : kris jenkins , the forward who had hit the winning jumper for villanova .
williams chose benevolence , allowing jenkins to work out with his players , but that loss to villanova â€” and the memory of it â€” was becoming nearly impossible for williams , his staff and his players to escape .
on sunday , he somehow outdid himself , sinking 6 of 9 shots from the field .
behind a player named maye , the tar heels are marching on . ''
2078,19613 , visiting mcdonald â€™ s with my grandmother - the new york times , new york times , christine ro,2017-03-27,2017.0,3.0 , , '' as a kid , i was in awe of my grandmother â€™ s ability to stretch a dollar when it came to food .
and she strategized for trips to mcdonald â€™ s .
she was korean , and the assortment of separate little dishes known as banchan is central to korean food .
these were more complicated than she â€™ d anticipated , because she ended up living in a predominantly mexican neighborhood .
so the move wasn â€™ t just about adapting to a majority white and majority culture .
she might have been disoriented by racial distinctions , but class differences she understood .
wealth insulated her from certain kinds of discomfort but didn â€™ t guard against her husband â€™ s steady stream of infidelities .
it bought her luxuries like breast implants , at a time when this was a bizarre purchase for a korean woman .
i was almost morbidly fascinated by those implants later on .
i knew her as an old woman , and there was a sharp contrast between the rocks on her chest and the softness and slackness of the rest of her body .
and yet , improbably , she was happy .
she smoked with abandon .
she ate whatever she wanted .
her bedroom became a kind of monument to her earlier life , packed with artworks , jewelry and expensive clothing â€” things to gradually sell off .
it is astonishing that my grandmother had any appetite for fast food after working on a chicken disassembly line .
she may have had a greater appreciation for food after spending her days among its raw ingredients .
or maybe it â€™ s telling that she generally avoided chicken at mcdonald â€™ s .
grandma kept a mental calendar of mcdonald â€™ s promotions .
when hamburgers were on sale for 29 cents each , she bought 10 at a time and kept a supply in the freezer .
as a treat , she sometimes splurged on the cheeseburger .
my grandmother also looked forward to each mcdonald â€™ s monopoly period , that marvel of synergistic marketing that turned every mcdonald â€™ s purchase into a prize opportunity .
cooking american food , especially , would have been daunting .
so after she died , as my family was preparing for the korean grave site ritual of bringing food loved by the deceased , i thought about collecting a burger , fries and america â€™ s best coffee .
i was overruled , so we ended up leaving korean takeaway noodles â€” jjamppong â€” on her grave instead .
the broth leaked out of the package , leaving a fishy smell and a mess on our hands .
my grandmother is buried in the notoriously forest lawn memorial park in glendale , calif. which strives for grandeur in its massive statues and chapels that are reproductions of the european originals .
as i placed the leaky package of noodles on her grave , i wondered , in my very unspiritual way , what would happen to the food .
that seemed inappropriate for my grandmother , who held on to frozen fast food for years , and didn â€™ t throw anything away .
i â€™ ve stepped inside a mcdonald â€™ s only a few times since grandma died , and it just isn â€™ t the same .
but its ubiquity is strangely comforting .
you don â€™ t need a fancy grave site to honor a relative , after all .
still , mr. schiff stopped short of pulling the panel â€™ s democrats out of the investigation .
the senate intelligence committee is running its own inquiry , and the f. b. i. has carried out a broad counterintelligence investigation since july .
that was when james b. comey , the director of the f. b. i. publicly disclosed the bureau â€™ s investigation for the first time .
that could prove fatal to the bipartisan investigation , which has hinged on the ability of mr. nunes to conduct a neutral inquiry while maintaining the trust and cooperation of mr. schiff .
â€ he also said officials were â€œ not concerned â€ about the prospect that someone within the executive branch had leaked classified information to mr. nunes .
acknowledging that the incidental collection from surveillance appeared to be legal , mr. nunes last week said his concerns surrounded additional names that may have been improperly â€œ unmasked .
nunes . ''
the white house counsel â€™ s office was informed this month that the senate intelligence committee , which is investigating russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , wanted to question mr. kushner about meetings he arranged with the russian ambassador , sergey i. kislyak , according to the government officials .
the meetings , which took place during the transition , included a previously unreported with the head of russia â€™ s development bank .
until now , the white house had acknowledged only an early december meeting between mr. kislyak and mr. kushner , which occurred at trump tower and was also attended by michael t. flynn , who would briefly serve as the national security adviser .
the f. b. i. declined to comment .
mr. kushner sent avrahm berkowitz , a white house aide and longtime associate .
mr. gorkov is a graduate of the academy of federal security service of russia , a training ground for russian intelligence and security forces .
both have denied doing anything unlawful .
the senate investigation is proceeding on a separate track from the f. b. i. investigation while drawing on some of the same material , like routine electronic surveillance of the russian ambassador and his embassy cohort .
depending on those interviews , some may be called upon to testify in sessions .
the new york times did not even mention medicaid , conceived as a small program to cover poor people â€™ s medical bills .
medicaid , so central to the country â€™ s health care system , also played a major , though far less appreciated , role in last week â€™ s collapse of the republican drive to repeal and replace the affordable care act , also known as obamacare .
the republican bill would have largely undone the expansion of medicaid under the a. c. a. which added 11 million adults to the program and guaranteed the federal government would cover almost all of their costs .
the nonpartisan congressional budget office predicted that the republican bill would have cumulatively cut projected spending on medicaid by $ 839 billion and reduced the number of medicaid beneficiaries by 14 million over the coming decade .
in 2015 , the nation spent more than $ 532 billion on medicaid , of which about 63 percent was federal money and the rest from the states .
still , last week â€™ s defeat reflected how hard it is to take away an entitlement .
it covers the costs of nearly half of all births in the united states .
and it provides for 10 million children and adults with physical or mental disabilities .
for states , it accounts for 60 percent of federal funding â€” meaning that cuts hurt not only poor and families caring for their children with autism or dying parents , but also bond ratings .
the a. c. a. offered a tempting deal to states that agreed to expand medicaid eligibility to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level â€” $ 16 , 400 for a single person â€” mostly workers like cooks , hairdressers and cashiers .
over the past three years , 31 states and the district of columbia took the deal .
it required medicaid to cover addiction and mental health treatment for those newly eligible .
the c. b. o. estimated that states would have gradually had to devote more of their own money to medicaid , cut payments to doctors , tighten eligibility or cut services covered .
but more broadly , the cuts would have almost inevitably affected every group covered by medicaid , including the biggest block of recipients : 36 million children as of last year .
â€ the cuts would also likely have eventually hit poor , chronically ill mothers like tracie scott of paulding , ohio .
â€œ it â€™ s been a lifesaver .
â€ for more than six million americans older than 64 , medicaid pays for nursing homes and other care that they would never otherwise be able to afford , while medicare covers their medical care .
for millions of disabled people , medicaid covers services provided at home or through local programs â€” aides who help them walk , eat and bathe , for example , and physical and speech therapy â€” that allow them to stay out of institutions , where care is often more expensive .
mr. theus was relieved when the bill failed .
this was the third major effort by republicans to end medicaid as an entitlement .
but this was the first time republicans tried it while they controlled the white house and both houses of congress .
the night of president john f. kennedy â€™ s assassination in november 1963 , lyndon johnson returned to his home in washington and , unable to sleep , summoned three aides .
among them was government health insurance .
democrats decided to take on a more limited goal : insurance for elderly people .
they called it medicare .
by the 1980s and â€™ 90s , health insurance was becoming prohibitively costly , and wages were starting to stagnate .
health insurance was eroding .
â€ in 1996 , mr. clinton expanded medicaid to cover more working families as part of his welfare overhaul .
but politics during mr. obama â€™ s presidency had become highly polarized .
and now that the law known as obamacare has survived the effort to repeal it , more states may choose to expand medicaid .
the genetic disorder causes tumors in vital organs , leading to frequent seizures , and mrs. goodloe had quit her job to take care of the boys when they were 4 â€” medicaid did not cover services for them back then .

for the purposes of this column , i â€™ m starting the count in 1955 when william f. buckley jr. founded national review , declaring it an outsider â€™ s antidote to the controlling influence of â€œ the united nations and the league of women voters and the new york times .
mr. hayes wanted to be a journalist .
after graduating from columbia university â€™ s journalism school and reporting for the political tip sheet â€œ the hotline , â€ he succeeded in 2001 .
â€œ that â€™ s a problem for our democracy , â€ he told me last week .
he had vowed to â€œ weaponize the conservative movement â€™ â€™ and to â€œ rectify the long problem that has been absolute media bias .
â€ ( some of those shots have been at mr .
hayes . )
as mr. breitbart predicted , new media has also provided the tools for anyone to start a website .
mr. hayes and i were speaking during a week in which the conservative news media was going through a between reporting and wild speculation and falsehoods .
with time magazine posing what should have been a bizarre question , but wasn â€™ t , on its cover â€” â€œ is truth dead ? â€ â€” it felt as if a time of choosing had arrived .
that means fewer opinionated takes that get ahead of what the reporting shows .
mr. hayes is gambling that audiences will reward such prudence .
there â€™ s no guarantee .
it was the only option he saw during this â€œ weird time for journalists .
â€ that is , time to go pro . ''

1 billion this year in various grants administered by the department .
sessions did not announce any new policy on monday .
last july , the department of justice under the obama administration announced a policy of conditioning federal grants on compliance with a 1996 federal statute .
the statute forbids imposing restrictions on the ability of the local police or sheriffs to exchange information with federal immigration authorities about the citizenship or immigration status of prisoners in their custody .
new york received about $ 53 million â€” a tiny fraction of its budget â€” from the justice department in the most recent fiscal year , according to city hall officials .

clusters of transport vehicles were parked on the shoulders of highways near major cities in what looked like preparations for roadblocks .
mr. navalny , 40 , a charismatic opposition figure , has long been caught up in multiple court cases that he calls politically motivated .
the court on monday also fined him about $ 350 for organizing an illegal demonstration .
mr. putin , as the â€œ good czar , â€ enjoys a status that the rest of the government falls short of .
the aftermath of the rallies will show whether there is a political thaw or not , wrote oleg kashin , another columnist .
the liberal radio station echo of moscow estimated that more than 60 , 000 people had participated .
â€œ almost a thousand young people of student age have taken to the streets .
instead , young russians tend to turn to independent voices who broadcast their own shows on youtube .
the immediate inspiration for sunday â€™ s protest was a nearly video compiled by mr. navalny and his colleagues and released on march 2 .

â€œ we can â€™ t express the same respect for those who consciously misinformed people .
mr. peskov defended the actions of the security forces , who often grappled with demonstrators and seemed to cart off some who had not been participating in the protests .
â€ the fate of all the arrested protesters in moscow and other cities was not clear .
at the site on sunday , more than a week after the bombing runs , reporters for the new york times saw weary survivors trying to find bodies in the wreckage .
hundreds of thousands of civilians are pinned down here in tight quarters with islamic state fighters who do not care if they live or die .

drinks are often followed by dinner , also from commander â€™ s , and wine .
ms. brennan favors champagne and distinguished whites from the cÃ´te de beaune because , as she puts it , â€œ i â€™ m too damn old to drink cheap wine â€ and â€œ because i can .
at 91 , she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1 , 400 people , both full and part time , and she has mentored countless talents , including the celebrity chefs paul prudhomme and emeril lagasse .

â€ in 1946 , mr. brennan bought vieux carrÃ© , a french quarter restaurant that ms. brennan described recently , with typical candor , as â€œ terrible .
â€œ i didn â€™ t know anything , â€ ms. brennan recalled .
â€œ but owen was a raconteur .
he slept till noon .
â€œ they were like surgeons .
all the while , ms. brennan worked with the chefs to elevate vieux carrÃ© â€™ s food .
for inspiration , she traveled frequently to new york city , where she became a regular at the â€œ 21 â€ club .
culinary pioneers like james beard and helen mccully , the food editor of mccall â€™ s magazine , took the young visitor under their wings .
it became a grand showcase for new orleans joie de vivre , replete with a wine cellar , antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional cuisine .
the national press took notice , especially of its boozy , multicourse breakfasts .
â€œ america was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment , â€ ms. brennan wrote , â€œ and all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food .
commander â€™ s palace , which ms. brennan acquired in 1969 , was a sprawling property in need of repair .
early reviews weren â€™ t favorable .
but over time , commander â€™ s became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south louisiana and nouvelle cuisines â€” ms. brennan christened the style haute creole â€” and its warm , celebratory approach to fine dining .
â€œ she was stern , and you â€™ d feel like you really messed up .
it also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long .
ms. brennan was as engaged and vivacious as when the evening began .

a lawyer representing mr .
mr .
â€ those cordial words stand in stark contrast to the invectives that were lobbed at each after mr .
gross sued the firm in october 2015 , accusing it of breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing .
yet the litigation had been a frustrating distraction for pimco as it sought to recover from the damage done by mr. gross â€™ s departure .
since his exit in september 2014 , pimco â€™ s assets have slid to $ 1 .
47 trillion , from more than $ 2 trillion at the peak .
for mr .
details that emerged on his split with pimco portrayed him as erratic and authoritarian before and after he was forced out .
the settlement may also provide some sort of resolution psychologically for the investor , who has said he closely monitors his performance against pimco and is â€œ fixated â€ on proving it was wrong to force him out .
in his lawsuit , mr .
the colorfully worded lawsuit took particular aim at mohamed the firm â€™ s former chief executive , and mr. ivascyn .
â€œ it is time for him to do the same .
emmanuel roman , the former chief of the british hedge fund manager man group , started as chief executive in november .

the complaint portrays mr .
gross for his 20 percent cut of the bonus pool , which in 2013 alone was $ 300 million .

most alarming to the residents were reports that the government was breaking with a longstanding policy of leasing the islands that are home to some of the world â€™ s premier resorts and selling the atoll outright to the saudis .
â€œ it is worrying that we may be taken from here and put in tiny apartment boxes , â€ said sobira aboobukaru , 58 , near the farm where she grows chilies and cucumbers .
â€ the maldivian president , abdulla yameen , has denied that the atoll will be sold , and the saudi embassy said it had no intention â€œ of investing in a megaproject or buying an island or atoll in the maldives .
it has also underscored how new allies and investors have gained a foothold in this strategic archipelago .

i â€™ d finished all the episodes of the show , but i needed more .
i was very worried about the 2016 election .

mr. nunes disputed that the investigation had stalled , though he noted that it was difficult for the committee â€œ to move forward with interviews and depositions â€ until members could speak to mr. comey again .
speaker paul d. ryan maintained on tuesday to reporters that he saw no reason for mr. nunes to step away from the investigation .

that timing has already been rejected by prime minister theresa may of britain , who must agree to any legally binding referendum on scotland â€™ s future .
nevertheless , the scottish parliament â€™ s vote sets the stage for a constitutional tussle between london and edinburgh , and it illustrates the and destabilizing , consequences of britain â€™ s divisive decision in june to withdraw from the european union .
in that referendum , 52 percent of voters chose to leave the european union .
in northern ireland , too , a majority voted to remain in the european union , amid fears that a withdrawal could weaken the peace process there .
during that time , mrs. may aims to agree to divorce terms and to negotiate a new economic relationship with the countries that remain in the european union .
mrs. may will also promise that , in negotiations , she will â€œ represent every person in the whole united kingdom , â€ including citizens of countries in the european union who have made britain their home .
but because of her control over the timing , a referendum on scottish independence is unlikely to happen anytime soon .
the vote on tuesday empowers scotland â€™ s first minister , nicola sturgeon , to formally request a referendum , but she already knows mrs. may â€™ s answer : not now .
at that time , scots were told that if they voted to leave britain , they would lose their place in the european union .
they may now lose it anyway .
â€ ms. sturgeon argues that the shape of any brexit deal should be known by autumn 2018 .

just last month , mr. giuliani and another prominent lawyer , michael b. mukasey , traveled to meet with the turkish president , recep tayyip erdogan , as part of their efforts on behalf of mr. zarrab , according to a person briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the trip .
mr. erdogan has publicly criticized mr. zarrab â€™ s prosecution in the united states .
â€ mr. zarrab has also been charged with conspiracies to commit money laundering and bank fraud .
mr. brafman , mr. mukasey and a spokeswoman for mr. giuliani each had no comment on monday .

mr. kim â€™ s office , responding with the filing in the evening , argued that a hearing was â€œ especially appropriate and necessary at this time if , as the letter from defense counsel indicates , mr. giuliani and mr. mukasey â€™ s involvement in this case is intended to occur entirely outside of the court â€™ s purview and knowledge .

it is forced on you .
it was how i discovered a great restaurant in town that was easy to miss unless you knew the way in : through a minimart , past the junk food aisle .
unless you slow down , you might miss st. john itself .
there is no airport or cruise ship dock , which keeps the tourist hordes down .
what really keeps st. john feeling so remote and unhurried is the fact that it is largely off limits to developers .
there are no hotels , no strip malls filled with and tchotchke shops , no barking beach vendors asking to braid your hair or sell you a drink in a coconut .
i was no stranger to st. john .
and every time i navigated the island â€™ s steep , serpentine roads in my jeep and stopped at the first overlook outside town , i would take in the 180 degrees of sparkling azure water and lush virgin mountainsides and catch myself : â€œ i can â€™ t believe this place is part of the united states .
this time , with my partner , brendan , i would take it slow .
over four days we took our rented jeep wrangler on as many of the passable roads on st. john as we could , stopping at all the beaches , bars , scenic lookouts and trails we had time for .
i should know , because i did the first time .
but it , too , is hidden from people in a rush .
there are few resorts in the caribbean as suited to their surroundings .
the beach chairs are a sandy brown .
being there feels like being a resident of an exclusive , republic .
tucked into a small cove book ended by rocks , the beach is a wide but fairly short strip of soft white sand with few people ever on it .
there is also a swimming pool on the property .
caneel may not come cheap , but it â€™ s not off limits or unwelcoming for those who have other uses for $ 800 a night .
had we trusted our own instincts and not asked around , we never would have found lunch at the little olive food truck , which sells greek dishes like chicken gyros , spanakopita and fiery feta fries â€” sweet potatoes dappled with sriracha , feta and oregano .
they are all generously portioned , if a bit messy .
another bonus our bartender took pride in : the bowery has no blender for frozen drinks .
our other find was a funky restaurant and bar called rhumb lines , inside the bayside mini mart .
just walk past a few aisles of potato chips , toiletries and soft drinks , step past the cash register â€” and a dinner of shrimp pad thai , grilled or sichuan tuna is waiting for you .
in this case , i was grateful for its conspicuousness , which drew us in and rewarded us with dishes like ahi tuna poke , sliders and fish tacos , which we washed down with the restaurant â€™ s signature gin and tonic .
you have to pass hawksnest and then look for the signs for peace hill , where the main attraction is a ruin on a windswept perch overlooking the water .
( the vista is definitely worth the short hike up before you start your trek down to the water . )
just as you start the trail that climbs up to the mill from a small parking lot , look right .
the beach has perfect white sand that is not so fine and soft that it sticks to you everywhere like wet flour .
and it â€™ s not so coarse that it scrubs your feet raw .
as we were floating on our backs , we noticed a little commotion down the beach .
chances are you will see plenty of them if you strap on a snorkel and mask .
the last census found only 51 people who lived there , on a little finger of rock and beach close to british waters .
the beaches are smaller here .
the vegetation is drier , with more cactuses .
we parked our car on the side of the road just a few steps from the water and got in .
there was also a place i had heard about but never seen .
and it was a little less conventional .
brendan apologized to peter as he handed him a soggy bill .

â€ ownage can be politically urgent or purely irreverent .
â€ on the internet , where rhetorical victories are so fleeting , the phrase is oddly satisfying : it â€™ s a passing but dramatic staking of argumentative ground .
â€œ owned â€ is borrowed from hacker slang .
if you got owned , that meant some hacker jimmied the lock on a virtual back door , snooped around your property and rifled through your stuff .
but â€œ you got owned â€ also animates a simple theft with a violent spark .
owning someone isn â€™ t just about taking his things it â€™ s about diminishing him as a person .
with enough specialized technical knowledge , you can actually seize control of another human being , or at least the person â€™ s virtual presence .
in the early aughts , underground online zines like zero for owned â€” zf0 for short â€” emerged as sites for hackers to detail how they broke into the systems of prominent security professionals and fellow hackers to shame them for overstating their skills .
â€œ we believe actions speak louder than words , â€ the first issue of zero for owned announced .
â€œ while you were talking trash , we were sifting through your files , reading your conversations , owning more boxes â€ â€” computers â€” â€œ on your networks , and you had no idea .
recent concerns over â€œ filter bubbles , â€ â€œ fake news â€ and political memes churned out by russian trolls lay bare the fact that our beliefs are controlled by the data we consume .
information silos make us vulnerable to being owned not only because of our ignorance â€” the things we don â€™ t know â€” but also because of how little control we have over the things we do know .
now president trump tweets conspiratorially about â€œ leaks â€ and â€œ wiretapping , â€ fixated on the idea that his political rivals have acquired or released his secrets â€” and obsessed with the suggestion that he is somehow an illegitimate president .
for thinkers throughout history , owning things was seen not just as useful and pleasant , but also as a source of human virtue .
â€ and of course there is the obvious strangeness in talking about people â€œ owning â€ one another online in a nation where , for a very long time , people did own other people â€” and where many of them argued that this was an ennobling endeavor for everyone involved .
the antebellum statesman john calhoun defended owning slaves as a â€œ positive good .
â€ to be â€œ â€ is to be confident and poised .
ownage just turns that back outward : now we wield our superior knowledge and skills over our rivals .
in the hacking context , owning someone is all about a display of superior technological abilities .
when the word migrated from hacking to gaming , â€œ owned â€ became a mantra for those who had mastered the game play or bested opponents .
now it extends to rhetorical force â€” a and withering joke or an irrefutable debate line .
n. l. â€ monologue .
as the usage of â€œ owned â€ spread , it also was mixed with stereotypes of hackers and gamers as being socially awkward .
now ownage communicates dominance , but it also belies an underlying impotence .
if an own exposes another person â€™ s ignorance , a reveals your own obliviousness .
â€ jindal owned himself .
that was a presidential .
owning someone sets you up to be owned yourself , sometimes in the same breath .
in the you let yourself down by being so nakedly yourself .
you fail , in the end , by being you . ''

â€œ we â€™ ll answer anything about the senate intelligence committee â€™ s investigation .

mr. warner laughed outright .
while a vast majority of republicans in the house have stood by mr. nunes amid calls for him to recuse himself , his furtive maneuvering â€” including bypassing his committee to brief the white house about relevant intelligence â€” has placed house committee members in a difficult spot .
on the house side , a string of perplexing decisions by mr. nunes has threatened to unravel the panel â€™ s investigation altogether .
last week , he abruptly announced that he had obtained information indicating that people associated with the trump transition may have been â€œ incidentally â€ caught up in legal surveillance of foreign operatives .
democrats have also chafed at mr. nunes â€™ s shuffling of the hearing schedule .
democrats have accused mr. nunes of trying to stall not only the investigation but also the committee as a whole .

mrs. may said in parliament that she was invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty , putting britain on track to leave the european union in 2019 and raising a host of thorny issues involved in untangling a relationship .
mrs. may told parliament , â€œ today , the government acted on the democratic will of the british people , and it acts too on the clear and convincing position of this house .
â€ â€œ the article 50 process is now underway , â€ she added , â€œ and , in accordance with the wishes of the british people , the united kingdom is leaving the european union .
â€ she added : â€œ this is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back .
â€ with this step , mrs. may enters what william hague , a former foreign secretary , called â€œ the most complex divorce ever in history .
â€ given her negotiating â€œ red lines , â€ the difference between whatever deal mrs. may can secure and no deal at all may turn out to be relatively small .
blaming the europeans for a collapse of the talks might be easier , politically , than bringing a weak agreement to parliament .
the last thing they want to do is lend greater momentum to the centrifugal forces already threatening to tear apart the european union .
â€ he added , â€œ we already miss you .
â€ manfred weber , a german lawmaker and a powerful conservative in the european parliament , wrote on twitter that â€œ from now on , only the interests of the remaining 440 million europeans count for us .
from agriculture to aviation , from fisheries to pharmaceuticals , britain â€™ s economy has been shaped by membership in the european union , its main trading partner .
without a deal , britain faces customs checks at its borders and tariffs on imports and exports , not to mention the relocation of at least part of its lucrative financial services sector .
in her letter to mr. tusk , mrs. may argued that without an overall agreement , â€œ our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened .
the commission estimates that britain owes as much as $ 64 billion in future spending commitments and pension entitlements for european union officials .
boris johnson , the foreign secretary , has rejected that idea , invoking the memory of prime minister margaret thatcher , who in 1984 demanded â€” and received â€” her â€œ money back â€ from european partners in another acrimonious negotiation .
â€œ if you go narrow , it is tremendously difficult , â€ mr. added .
another is the illusion among some britons that they can dictate the terms of a deal .
time will be a problem , too .

for the first time , the european bloc is losing a member , not to mention its economy .
that thesis is speculative , too , and will be tested next month in france , where the traditional parties have imploded and the nationalist marine le pen , if victorious , has promised to take france out of the european union .
â€œ the e. u. is more powerful than any single actor , even germany , so anything that diminishes a rival in the terms in which russia thinks strengthens the russian voice in europe .
partly pressed by britain , the united states â€™ main ally , the european union has been tough on russia over its annexation of crimea , and the bloc has moved to cut europe â€™ s dependence on russian natural gas .
in germany , chancellor angela merkel remains popular in the polls , although weakened by her long service in the job and by severe criticism of her 2015 â€œ â€ immigration policy .
the alternative for deutschland is slipping , however , and ms. merkel â€™ s main challenger is the martin schulz of the social democrats , the former head of the european parliament .
he and his chief political adviser , stephen k. bannon , are deeply skeptical of multilateralism , free trade and â€œ entangling alliances .
â€ while nato may pass muster as a security shield ( provided everyone pays up ) the european union , like the united nations , seems an example of the world that mr. trump and mr. bannon want to dismantle or , at the very least , weaken .
some envision the country â€™ s fate as being a european equivalent of singapore , sovereign and respected , a partner eagerly sought by the rest of the world .
â€ for those british lawmakers in favor of the withdrawal , like jacob a conservative legislator , the exit â€œ is a wonderful liberation for my country .

2150,19689 , those indecipherable medical bills ?
when her alarmed teenage son called an ambulance , the paramedics thought that she had food poisoning and didn â€™ t take her to the emergency room .
later , when she became confused and groggy at 3 a. m. her boyfriend raced her to sentara norfolk general hospital in coastal virginia , where a scan showed she was suffering from a subarachnoid hemorrhage .
a vessel had burst , and blood was leaking into the narrow space between the skull and the brain .
during a subarachnoid hemorrhage , if the pressure in the head isn â€™ t relieved , blood accumulates in that narrow space and can push the brain down toward the neck .
vital nerves that control breathing and vision are compressed .
death is imminent .
after his death , wickizer worked in a series of jobs , but none provided health insurance .
she felt she couldn â€™ t afford that .
and so in early 2014 , without an insurer or employer or government agency to run interference between her and the hospital , she began receiving bills : $ 16 , 000 from sentara norfolk ( not including the scan or the e. r. doctor ) $ 50 , 000 for the air ambulance .
â€œ i thought , o. k. that â€™ s not so bad , â€ wickizer recalls .
but over the last several decades in the united states , codes gradually took on a bedrock financial function as the basis for medical billing .
in 1979 , the government decided to use what by then were called codes â€” which specify the patient â€™ s diagnosis â€” in adjudicating medicare and medicaid claims , with some modifications added specifically for that purpose the united states version was called .
21 ) the difference could mean thousands of dollars .
each billing decision , then , can be seen as a battle of coder versus coder .
while most hospitals and insurers set their own rates for each level of care , adding a step when interacting with a patient can also bring windfalls .
it publishes coding books and dictionaries .
5 times more than they charge those covered by health insurance ( who are billed negotiated rates ) and three times more than the amount allowed by medicare .
first , she took stock of her finances .
she paid the rent for the norfolk apartment that she and her children lived in by renting out a townhouse that she and her deceased husband had bought in virginia beach after paying property tax , insurance and maintenance on the townhouse , she just broke even .
she also received about $ 2 , 000 a month in social security survivor benefits because of her husband â€™ s death .
with medical bills totaling nearly $ 500 , 000 and no health insurance , the numbers didn â€™ t add up .
â€œ but they did .
nearly simultaneously , she received a bill for the hospital portion of her care , broken down only into the broadest categories , including $ 111 , 162 in room charges , $ 34 , 755 .
75 for pharmacy , $ 19 , 653 for labs , $ 8 , 640 for the operating room , $ 8 , 325 for anesthesia , $ 1 , 143 for the recovery room , $ 44 , 524 for medical supplies and $ 40 , 489 for radiology services , totaling $ 356 , 884 .
42 .
58 .
she estimated that in 2013 , her subarachnoid hemorrhage ( most likely coded , she determined , as â€œ intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction disorders , drg 021 , with procedures and major comorbidities or complications â€ ) would have been reimbursed by medicare for about $ 80 , 000 .
when the billers called insisting on payment of the full $ 285 , 507 .
58 , wickizer explained , â€œ i don â€™ t have this kind of money .
it was an untenable amount .
eric swensen , a spokesman for the university of virginia , declined to answer questions about the case , citing patient privacy , as governed by hipaa rules .
but he noted that the university provides $ 270 million worth of free care to patients who meet its criterion for assistance and sets up payment plans for those who don â€™ t .
multiple legal requests to review wickizer â€™ s chart and complete bill â€” with its coding elucidated â€” were refused .
from there , they tried to extrapolate how the hospital had , perhaps , coded her case .
the stealth battle between hospitals and insurers over bills for each hospitalization , office visit , test , piece of equipment and procedure is costly for us all .
similarly , when medicare announced that it would pay only a set fee for the first hour and a half of a chemotherapy infusion â€” and a bonus for time thereafter â€” a raft of infusions clocked in at 91 minutes .
advanced coding consultants advise lesser coders .
the collectors are often paid a percentage of the money they recover .
â€ he noted , too , that the small rental property that wickizer owned â€” appraised at $ 90 , 200 in 2014 â€” was considered fair game for the hospital to seize as payment .
he added : â€œ if we obtain a lien on real estate , we do not seek to sell the property if it is the patient â€™ s primary residence .
â€ by then , wickizer was recovering physically and had married her boyfriend .
nearly a year later , wickizer remains exhausted by the ordeal .
now working as a clerk in a small store , she would like to go back to her previous work as a bookkeeper , she told me when we spoke in march .

â€” on a blistering day last august , the novelist philipp meyer was at a cattle ranch in the grassy hill country of central texas , standing in a field that had been turned into a replica of a comanche camp .
the makeshift village â€” with about 20 tepees , wooden racks holding strips of drying meat and buffalo hides spread on the ground â€” was the backdrop for a grueling scene from amc â€™ s adaptation of mr. meyer â€™ s 2013 novel , â€œ the son , â€ an epic western about a texas ranching family .
the series stars pierce brosnan as eli mccullough , the family â€™ s steely patriarch , who was captured by comanches as a teenager in 1849 and later becomes a cattle rancher with a violent , vengeful streak .
mr. meyer watched as makeup artists applied fake blood and ash to the prosthetic limbs of a white buffalo hunter who had been captured and tortured by the comanches .
but it â€™ s rare for them to have as much of a creative stake as mr. meyer does in â€œ the son , â€ and he â€™ s feeling the pressure .
whether â€œ the son â€ succeeds , critically and commercially , could determine whether el jefe becomes a big player in the already heated competition for literary properties , which have become a staple of prestige television .
so when â€œ the son , â€ which became a critically acclaimed best seller that sold 300 , 000 copies and was a finalist for the pulitzer prize , caught the interest of several production companies , he agreed to mr. mcgreevy â€™ s pitch .

mr. brosnan took his place , and had to prepare for the role on the fly .

mr. meyer takes a approach to writing .
at a ranch in southwest texas , he shot a buffalo and drank a mug full of its blood , so that he could accurately describe the taste when young eli eats a raw buffalo liver .
â€œ it â€™ s taken me weeks to memorize , â€ said zahn mcclarnon , who plays toshaway , a comanche warrior who takes eli under his wing .
some of the native american actors expressed concern that the comanches were portrayed as savages who relished rape and torture .
the episode features jacob lofland as young eli , who â€™ s been living with the tribe and feels torn over the fate of another captive , a white buffalo hunter who is being tortured to death .
â€œ the best political stance to take is honesty .

the south korean company on wednesday introduced the galaxy s8 , its first major smartphone release since the scandal over its galaxy note 7 smartphones , which were discontinued last year after some of the devices spontaneously caught fire .
â€œ it â€™ s been a challenging year for samsung , â€ said d. j. koh , the company â€™ s head of mobile devices , adding that samsung was ready to start anew .
samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display .

time â€” and sales â€” will tell whether the galaxy s8 will restore confidence in samsung â€™ s smartphones .
but replacement phones continued to catch fire , and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether , sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue .
on monday , samsung said that it might sell refurbished versions of the phone .

and now , after a ruling from european regulators on wednesday , all three efforts have failed .
but the deal faced a number of questions , particularly after german regulators and politicians balked at the combined exchange having its headquarters in london even as britain moves forward with plans to leave the european union .
but as britain leaves the bloc making such deals may become even thornier .
last month , the london exchange said that the deal was unlikely to be approved after european regulators â€” who had opened an investigation in september â€” unexpectedly added a condition that it sell a majority stake in mts , an electronic platform for trading european government bonds and other fixed income products .
german regulators and lawmakers had also become increasingly concerned in recent months about the combined company having its headquarters in london after last year â€™ s referendum in britain on european union membership .
they have pushed for the headquarters to be in frankfurt .
in seeking approval for the deal , the london stock exchange group agreed in january to sell lch , the french operating arm of the lch .
â€ the sale was contingent on the approval by european regulators of the deutsche stock exchange transaction .
regulators found that the parties proposed remedy of selling lch would have addressed only its concerns about equity derivatives , but not its unease about fixed income clearing .
the intercontinental exchange had been seen as a potential rival in the deal for the london stock exchange , but it opted in may not to pursue an acquisition .
and it looks as though it may have been the part that mr. hannity found the most insulting .
but in the televised footage , he was shown complaining about socialism , liberalism and â€œ angry snowflakes , â€ slang for liberals that conservatives see as easily upset .
â€ mr. koppel responded , â€œ yeah .
â€œ that â€™ s sad , ted .
that â€™ s sad .
â€ why did mr. koppel think mr. hannity â€™ s show was bad for america ?
he has also demanded that cbs release the full tape of his interview , which he called â€ a very good , substantive .
â€ bill o â€™ reilly , another fox host , and brit hume , a political analyst at the network , repeated that call on monday night .
so did the conservative commentator michelle malkin , who called the mr. koppel â€œ ancient â€ and a â€œ walking dead decrepit media elitist .
mr. koppel has not responded to mr. hannity .
so what does he do ?
â€œ honestly , i think liberalism has to be defeated .
â€œ this is not a â€” we don â€™ t want a revolution in this country .

in other words , his opinion is that all muslims are potential terrorists .
â€ nawaz , a muslim himself , bristled with frustration at the claim .
with each grisly new assault â€” and the specter of syria and the islamic state looming beyond it â€” the voices of hatred and reaction in the united states and throughout britain and europe found not only sympathetic ears but also willing hands to pull levers in the voting booths .
â€œ our presence is needed in america to reassure the mainstream , whereas our presence is needed in europe to stop radicalization .
â€ despite such deliberate affirmations and qualifications , there is nonetheless confusion as to where nawaz â€™ s sympathies actually lie .
according to vice news , he has earned a â€œ terrorism â€ designation on thomson reuters a database .
( thomson reuters would not confirm this . )
but , last october , the southern poverty law center took the incredible step of including him on a â€œ field guide to extremists , â€ which they published with three other research organizations .
nawaz claims that the listing has compromised some funding for the organization .
early in nawaz â€™ s 2012 memoir , â€œ radical : my journey out of islamist extremism , â€ there â€™ s an scene .
the narrator , an irreligious , n. w. a. child , has resorted to strapping a knife under his shirt for fear of the gangs of skinheads that stalk his essex suburb , southend .
he is 15 , and on this afternoon , he is with his older brother , kaashif ( identified by a pseudonym in the book ) and a friend who has converted to islam .
neighborhood racists have chased the boys with baseball bats and now have them cornered and outnumbered .
the skinheads â€™ leader steps forward and asks to talk .
the anecdote , which surfaces repeatedly in â€œ radical â€ and ultimately swells to the dimensions of a creation myth , is quintessential nawaz .
in other words , these were islamists but not jihadists , and the distinction isn â€™ t frivolous .
in september 2001 , after stints of organizing and recruiting for h. t. in london and pakistan , nawaz took his first wife and their infant son to alexandria , egypt , where he posed as an student while secretly proselytizing for the group .
four attackers bombed a bus and three subway trains , claiming 52 lives .
a man nawaz calls omar , a dagestani bomb maker , had celebrated the slaughter .
he rather colorfully compares it to a breakup with a lover .
as his critics constantly stress , nawaz â€™ s timing was convenient the british government was then looking to finance organizations and provided quilliam with early funding .
nawaz , then , is somewhat like british petroleum when it is tasked with cleaning up a catastrophic oil spill : his main qualification to do this kind of decontamination work is precisely his experience as a contaminator .
as recently as the islamist ideology was unpopular in british muslim communities .
â€œ we had to really hone our argumentative skills and our ability to convince and influence people as that vanguard of the islamist movement in the west .
â€ he insists his background as an islamist is what allows him and others at quilliam today not only to pinpoint islamism â€™ s weaknesses but also to employ the very same tenacious ability to communicate ideas and influence people for the purpose now of advocating liberal values .
â€œ they â€™ re transferable skills â€ is how he once put it to me .
â€ and that may be harder than it seems .
an online poll done in britain following the bombings , for example , showed that more than a fifth of british muslims felt some sympathy for the bombers â€™ feelings and motives more than half said they could understand the bombers â€™ behavior and nearly a third agreed that â€œ western society is decadent and immoral and that muslims should seek to bring it to an end â€ by nonviolent means .
it is this last contention that seems to be the crux of the s. p. l. c. complaint against nawaz , along with the disclosure that , in 2010 , quilliam provided a list of nonviolent â€œ islamist â€ organizations to a british counterterrorism official .
the surveys and the polls tell you that .
the organization hummed with the energy and sense of mission of a tech .
though he is the face of the organization , he is hardly the only employee with an exotic rÃ©sumÃ© .
on my first visit , my eyes fixed on a small prayer rug draped neatly over the arm of a desk chair .
back across the hall there was also dr. usama hasan , the head of islamic studies at the organization .
he was forced to stop delivering friday prayers when 50 muslim protesters stormed his lecture and openly called for his execution .
but they also engage ordinary muslims and alike through outreach work , organizing debate and training programs in europe and the middle east .
yet that has not been the case .
nawaz â€™ s layered arguments and concessions â€” his insistence , for example , that islam does have something to do with islamism â€” provoke a visceral suspicion among those who are concerned with fighting islamophobia above all .
a term that you will hear with frequency from nawaz is â€œ the regressive left , â€ as in purportedly progressive institutions like the s. p. l. c. that , often starting from a legitimate concern that muslims en masse not be persecuted for the actions of a few , nonetheless embody a perplexingly backward when it comes to islam .
attack pieces about nawaz have practically become their own literary genre .
â€œ as a journalist , you can exploit that .
â€ he shrugged soberly .
if his life story can be shown to be contrived , the deeper message , however compelling , can be dismissed : not only is the messenger â€™ s life not a genuine muslim life , when seen from this angle , it may even prove to be an life .
nawaz and benotman have been targeted by al qaeda and isis affiliates , and he travels under an alias .
he â€™ s been criticized in the british press for drinking and receiving a lap dance at a strip club , but in situations like this , it â€™ s strange to think of nawaz as having been anything like a humorless extremist .
i fell into conversation with nawaz â€™ s mother and little sister and lost track of time as the space filled up all around us .
like the he once aspired to be , he thrills to the sound of his own voice flowing through the microphone .
and therein lies the biggest challenge confronting quilliam in europe and , as it seeks to expand , in america : though nawaz himself is a star , there is something both noble and perilously square about this kind of forced secularism .
i watched an agitated young arab man and his wife , in full abaya , shut themselves inside the bathroom along with all of their luggage .
â€ though he meant this defense of human prejudice to reassure me , it did not .
i almost wish he had accused me of islamophobia â€” at least then the conversation might have achieved a certain clarity .
but nawaz , the consummate thinker , then took care to layer on several more shades of gray .

( â€œ the press is the enemy , â€ nixon told his aides .
their thin skin .
their skyscraping paranoia .
their cavernous memory for slights .
nixon , too , had a penchant for sowing mayhem and a gourmand â€™ s appetite for revenge , especially in the wee hours of the morning .
some readers may find farrell â€™ s portrait too sympathetic â€” he â€™ s as apt to describe nixon as a tortured depressive as he is to call him a malevolent sneak â€” but more readers , i think , will find this book complicating and .
he doesn â€™ t start out as a rampaging narcissist and megalomaniac .
over time , it was power combined with profound insecurity that misshaped him .

farrell follows a mostly chronological structure .
they â€™ re endearing and pathetic , the desperate pleas of the runt of the litter .
a. c. p. so progressive was he on matters of race .
you can also draw a through line from nixon â€™ s contempt for the liberal elite to trump â€™ s boastful claims of political incorrectness .
during nixon â€™ s presidency , he signed the occupational safety and health act and established the environmental protection agency .
he appears to sail through life unencumbered by introspection .
he â€™ d yield no more depth if you used an oil rig .
â€œ they just flake off .
â€ the talons were out , in other words , but this was not a catfight .
rather , their characters fight by issuing new products , raiding staff and investing in premium real estate : penthouses and country spreads for rubinstein , who donated millions of dollars to arts education and other causes through her foundation an irish castle and lexington , ky. breeding stable for arden , who was passionately devoted to horses and marched with suffragists .
but the fact that its principal creators are all men might arch an eyebrow .
he called her for advice before proceeding .
â€ mr. stone and ms. lupone both wrinkle their noses at the word â€œ diva , â€ a description cribbed from italian opera that is now often applied to any commanding female presence in the entertainment industry , inevitably also suggesting an excess of temperament .
â€œ diva implies difficult .
â€ at a talk about the show a few months ago , ms. lupone proposed â€œ dame â€ as an alternative , to approving whoops from the audience .
they brought in the composer scott frankel , the lyricist michael korie and the book writer doug wright , mr. greif â€™ s collaborators on the musical â€œ grey gardens , â€ inspired by the maysles brothers â€™ cult documentary about the eccentric aristocrats â€œ big edie â€ beale and her daughter , â€œ little edie .

in syria , it has airlifted local forces to positions and has been accused of killing civilians in airstrikes .
concerns about the recent accusations of civilian casualties are bringing some of these details to light .
but some of the shifts have also involved small increases in the deployment and use of american forces or , in yemen , resuming aid to allies that had previously been suspended .
plans have been announced to send 300 united states marines to helmand province , their first deployment there since 2014 .
it also launched frequent airstrikes to kill individual jihadists or to destroy their facilities and sent thousands of american troops back to iraq to train and advise iraqi forces , and also provide firepower , so they could â€œ degrade and ultimately destroy â€ the islamic state .
but under mr. obama , the white house often spent weeks or even months deliberating certain raids and airstrikes out of concern for american service members and civilians â€” and often to the frustration of commanders and american allies .
under mr. obama , the united states provided military support to the coalition , but halted the sale of munitions over concerns that airstrikes by saudi arabia and its allies were killing too many civilians .
that is more strikes than the united states had carried out during any other full year on record .
â€œ as the military line has surged , there has not been a surge in diplomacy , â€ said katherine zimmerman , a research fellow at the american enterprise institute .
it has also built ties with the iraqi security forces , and with kurdish and arab fighters in syria to battle the jihadists on the ground .
the military has been accused of killing about 30 syrians in an airstrike on a school , but has insisted that the early indications show it hit islamic state fighters .
the decision , according to officials familiar with internal deliberations , gives commanders at the united states africa command greater latitude to carry out offensive airstrikes and raids by ground troops against militants with the islamist group shabab .
those rules , known as the presidential policy guidance , required interagency vetting of proposed strikes .
â€œ so , we are very , very conscious of that .
at that same dinner , mr. mattis also presented proposals to similarly remove swaths of yemen from the targeting limits and carry out a raid against yemen â€™ s qaeda branch .

mr .
shortly after 3 a. m. judge kang issued the warrant and ms. park was taken to a jail outside seoul , the south korean capital .
once her trial begins in the coming weeks , ms. park will commute from her cell to a seoul courthouse .
ms. park was accused of conspiring with a longtime confidante , choi to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses , including more than $ 38 million in bribes from samsung .
on thursday , hundreds of emotional supporters were gathered near her red brick house in southern seoul as her motorcade pulled out for the hearing .
protesters also threw yellow plastic police fences at uniformed officers who tried to push them back .
the ride was nationally televised , with a fleet of television crews following her car .
in 1974 , her mother , yuk was fatally shot by a korean assassin who had targeted her husband .
after leaving the presidential blue house , ms. park lived in seclusion , unmarried and without children .
in 2013 , she returned to the blue house , her childhood home , after winning the presidential election .
older south koreans were among her most fervent supporters , while critics warned that she was trying to take the country back to its authoritarian past .
in a speech last november , as the growing scandal paralyzed her government , she tearfully confided that she regretted ever becoming president .
while a majority of south koreans believe her ouster was merited , ms. park â€™ s fall from grace has been hard to accept for many older , conservative south koreans who still worshiped her father and family as koreans once did their ancient kings .
â€œ please forgive me , your highness .
â€ since she returned to her home on march 12 , hundreds of supporters holding south korean flags have been rallying daily outside the house to protest her impeachment and oppose her arrest .
ms. park , who has never accepted the constitutional court ruling that ended her presidency , did not answer questions shouted from reporters as she walked into the courthouse on thursday .
but she had earlier denied any legal wrongdoing .
they took to the streets in central seoul , up to two million at a time , marching peacefully to demand her resignation .

2177,19716 , '' cut the cord , but keep the films ?
as multidevice streaming rapidly evolves into something like the norm , the concept of has started becoming a reality for some viewers .
in any event , it appears that the situation for many consumers involves keeping cable and shuffling various streaming services .
so in addition to all the other monthly bills , we are also , in this scenario , forced to keep up with individual fees for streaming services .
â€œ watching tv is more complicated than ever , â€ a pitchman on a broadcast ad for tv guide announced in the 1980s .
wherever that fellow is now , i bet he â€™ s terribly confused .
with all this in mind , i â€™ ve assembled three discrete monthly streaming â€œ packages â€ for dedicated movie watchers to consider .
package 1 : â€˜ the mainstreamer â€™ its foundational pillars are amazon video ( $ 8 .
99 ) and netflix ( $ 9 .
99 ) .
hulu carries more television shows than movies , but it â€™ s not light on movies , particularly popular ones .
unless you like to watch commercials , in which case your hulu will run $ 7 .
99 .
add hbo now ( $ 14 .
99 ) starz ( $ 8 .
99 ) and showtime ( $ 10 .
99 ) .
that â€™ s $ 65 .
94 worth of monthly streaming .
( explorers of amazon prime will point out that there â€™ s a good deal of hbo programming already free through the service this doesn â€™ t include movies currently on hbo , or the most recent original programming , including movies .
but if you want to rent or purchase a film on demand , either a classic or something recently released in theaters , there are also movies available Ã  la carte , from $ 2 .
99 to $ 14 .
99 , available on amazon , vudu , google play , itunes and more .
let â€™ s postulate that each month you spend $ 2 .
99 , $ 4 .
99 and $ 14 .
97 .
so the services and a few potentially purchases , you â€™ re looking at $ 88 .
91 .
not exactly cheap , but were i to pitch it to you with the proviso â€œ less than $ 100 a month , â€ you might think , â€œ not bad .
99 a month .
it â€™ s $ 6 .
99 a month without criterion , but you â€™ ll want criterion , for its smartly chosen array of largely foreign cinematic milestones .
warner archive ( $ 9 .
then there â€™ s the streaming art house mubi ( $ 5 .
99 as opposed to $ 47 .
99 ) .
fandor , an eclectic and often exciting service with thousands of movies ranging from martial arts romps such as â€œ master of the flying guillotine â€ to expansive , obscure french brainteasers like â€œ out 1 , â€ is $ 10 a month .
and the solid indie provider sundance now , which also offers original series , is $ 6 .
99 .
that â€™ s about $ 44 a month .
you â€™ ll need warner archive ( $ 9 .
99 ) the blaxploitation service brown sugar ( $ 3 .
99 ) and the horror specialist screamhouse ( $ 4 .
â€ shudder , another horror service ( $ 4 .
( in fairness to shudder , the actual provenance of an uncut version of this movie is highly obscure . )
amazon â€™ s video service is rife with noir titles in various states of disrepair or restoration .
a lot of genre stuff in the public domain ( until a copyright owner can effectively yell â€œ foul !
99 ) to this bill of fare .
crunchyroll has an membership for $ 6 .
95 .
total : a little over $ 45 with amazon added as a digging option , a little under $ 55 .
all this of course can be supplemented by free services other than youtube , like the site of dvd label shout !
if only there was a service that would allow one to buy leisure time , we â€™ d be all set . ''

but it soon becomes clear that the homicide story is a bit of a red herring .
some â€œ serial â€ fans may be disappointed to learn that the crew â€™ s latest offering is not a straightforward whodunit .
they shouldn â€™ t be .
there is that murder , but also a treasure hunt , a land grab and a mysterious benefactor .
mr. reed â€™ s investigation turns psychological and emotional â€” into how people come to be branded as bad , and the hidden relationships among men in the rural south .
it â€™ s kind of a podcast spinoff , and it unfolds more like a novel than a procedural .
mr. mclemore is its beguiling principal character .
he â€™ s got a backyard labyrinth , gold buried in an undisclosed location and a literary flair that turns life into big drama .
he â€™ s the peppiest pessimist south of the line .

most reporters would stop taking those calls when the story ideas don â€™ t bear fruit , but not mr. reed .
â€ also , â€œ â€ mercifully departs from â€œ serial â€ by releasing all of its seven episodes at once .
the style of â€œ serial â€ and stylistic offshoots like â€œ missing richard simmons â€ holds an addictive appeal , but it â€™ s also a risky gambit that rarely pays off .
assembling the whole story before its release frees mr. reed to pace out a real narrative , including an emotional twist at the end of the second episode that turns the whole thing upside down .
you should probably start listening now before somebody spoils the twist .
but then , take your time with the story â€” â€œ â€ is so much more than its central mystery . ''

( the two holdings accounted for nearly half the fund â€™ s holdings at the end of the year , according to its most recent securities filings . )
sears holdings shares were $ 162 in 2006 this week they were barely above $ 11 .

5 billion in 2007 bailed out of the fund in 2013 .
( mr. cohen left sears canada before mr. lampert arrived . )
â€ sears and other retail chains , of course , have been battered over the last decade by forces beyond mr. lampert â€™ s control , especially the rise of internet retailing .
mr. lampert claims to have foreseen the trend .
â€ he pointed to the contrast between sears and home depot , whose shares have nearly tripled in the last five years , despite the internet and competition from amazon .
2 billion .
( esl investments holds 48 percent of sears holdings â€™ s equity and 32 percent of its total debt . )
as creditors , they could end up owning sears if it reorganizes in bankruptcy , while other sears shareholders would be wiped out .
last month , mr. lampert and the sears board agreed to pay $ 40 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming that sears â€™ s sale and of much of its most valuable real estate to a real estate investment trust â€” 43 percent owned by mr. lampert and his esl hedge fund â€” was a blatant conflict of interest that harmed sears shareholders .
3 billion .
but that â€™ s a dollars less than forbes estimated back in 2006 .
2 on the forbes list , just behind bill gates , with a net worth of $ 67 billion .
through a spokesman , mr. lampert declined to comment .

mrs. may has only set in motion the complex , politically fraught divorce proceedings through which britain must settle its affairs with the 27 jilted members of the european union .

those talks have a deadline .
if no deal is struck before then , britain and europe would plunge into a state of chaotic uncertainty .

there â€™ s a certain amount of the type of art the met is too comfortable with : imperial bling .
but here even this material feels purposeful , because it dates from a time in china when the idea of empire and corporate branding through art was experimental .

whatever its origins , the new sculpture adds another facet to the profile of : cosmopolitan taste .
the emperor spent a lot of time on the road , surveying his domain but also on a quest for elixirs .
his sudden death unleashed an drama of assassinations , suicides and civil war , until another imperial power , called han , took its place , and held it more than four centuries .
the big personalities in han sculpture in the show are animals : horses as majestic as gods elephants , foreign to china , closely observed .
even common barnyard creatures â€” chickens , goats and pigs â€” are portrayed with empathy you can almost hear them clucking and snuffling .

i do it just in case , or because i â€™ m a coward , or at least because i â€™ m not as courageous as your footsteps member .
on the night faigy mayer died , her body lay on fifth avenue until it was wrapped up with all the blood and tissue around it , according to jewish tradition , and sent to borough park to her bewildered parents and their local funeral home .
women from the community stayed with her body all night , washing and guarding it .
they just wanted to mourn their friend .
before faigy â€™ s father began the eulogy in yiddish , he addressed them , notable for their lack of black hats and their lack of beards .

it is the latest twist of a bizarre washington drama that began after dark on march 21 , when mr. nunes got a call from a person he has described only as a source .
that does not appear to be the case .
several current american officials identified the white house officials as ezra the senior director for intelligence at the national security council , and michael ellis , a lawyer who works on national security issues at the white house counsel â€™ s office and was previously counsel to mr. nunes â€™ s committee .
â€œ it should be the substance .

his actions have fueled criticism that the committee , under his leadership , is unable to conduct a serious , independent investigation .
yet mr. nunes has dismissed democratic calls to step aside .
american officials are increasingly concerned that north korea may already have mounted a nuclear weapon on an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the united states or will very soon be able to do so .
during his presidential campaign , mr. trump criticized china for unfair trade practices , accusing it of draining millions of jobs from the united states through a huge imbalance .
â€ but these cases aren â€™ t an economic game changer .
it would strike at the heart of the trade deficit .
each year , the united states buys $ 4 worth of chinese goods for each $ 1 worth of american goods that china buys .
import taxes plus value added taxes â€” a kind of sales tax â€” total 27 percent in china and roughly 25 percent in western europe .
chinese officials have been watching the issue with rapt attention .
the tax would amount to a single action by the united states and would apply equally to trade with all foreign countries â€” not just china .
a flurry of trade restrictions by the united states might not add up to a lot of money , because bilateral trade is divided into thousands of categories .

corkscrew aside , a stemmed glass is the only indispensable piece of equipment needed to enjoy the best a bottle has to offer , and the least expensive , easiest way to invest in better drinking is to buy a good set .
not that wine can â€™ t be consumed without them .
you may even drink straight from the bottle , though i recommend reserving this method for celebrations .
recently , i joined my colleagues at the sweethome , a product review site owned by the new york times company , to test more than 50 different wine glasses .
this is nonsense .
they should not be so big that a third of a glass holds an absurd amount .
the rule of thirds allows for swirling without fear of consequences .
this desirable vertical shape is often called a bordeaux glass , which is generally contrasted with a burgundy glass , which has a shorter , wider , more rounded bowl .
the glass should not be hued , beveled or decorated in any way that may interfere with its clarity .
nor should it flare outward like a martini glass .
similarly , german riesling is often served in small , narrow glasses with a slight flare outward .
however , the aromas and flavors of the wine are not always the primary concern .
at times , you may see general references to white wine glasses and red wine glasses .
â€ nowadays , nothing about white wine is subordinate to red , so there is no need for smaller glasses unless , for some reason , it â€™ s a preference .
lesser glasses may have a discernible ridge where the bowl joins the stem , and a thick lip at the rim .
a few words about stemless glasses : i don â€™ t like them .
sure , tumblers are fine for unremarkable wines in casual situations .
they can be held by the stem so that the temperature of the wine won â€™ t be altered by the warmth of the hands , and so fingerprints won â€™ t smudge the glass .
i don â€™ t recommend them .
in the end , let your taste be your guide . ''
repeat after me : wine is food - the new york times , new york times , eric asimov,2017-03-17,2017.0,3.0 , , '' many people seek an easy formula for choosing better wines .
all you have to do is remember three words : wine is food .
this may sound absurd to people whose idea of wine appreciation is swilling a little red in a bar while their friends are downing cocktails or beer .
but wine in the classic sense is not a cocktail replacement .
it is an integral part of a meal , served at the table , with food .
and for me , a simple way to understand wine , to elevate the quality of what you consume and the pleasure you take in it , is to treat wine as if it were another staple of the table , just as you would the produce , meat and bread that you shop for and eat .
shopping is no longer a matter of driving the car to the supermarket and loading up it carries a host of ethical , political and aesthetic considerations .
where and how is food grown and raised ?
how are animals treated ?
all of these considerations are fundamental to the food revolution that has vastly improved both the quality of what we eat and the pleasure we take in it .
these wines are not the simple , pastoral expressions of an agricultural culture .
what â€™ s more , many small farmers of great integrity work organically , or adhere to even stricter principles than the definition requires , but don â€™ t bother certifying their work because of the expense and bureaucracy involved .
so labels are not always meaningful .
why should wine be immune to such labeling requirements ?
shouldn â€™ t we want to know what â€™ s in our wine , too ?
that may be true , but it â€™ s irrelevant .
millions of people could not care less and buy these products anyway .
thinking of wine as food will affect shopping decisions in another important way .
many people who may care enough to buy meat , fish , bread and produce from specialty purveyors or farmers â€™ markets continue to buy their wine in supermarkets , retailers or convenience stores .
if you care about wine , that is a mistake .
you may happen on a good bottle , but chances are you will not .
treating wine as food clarifies the notion of what it is you have on the table .

time magazines piled up around her apartment and gathered dust after she bought a subscription simply because it came with an offer for extra points .

tells u.k. - the new york times '' , new york times , james kanter,2017-03-31,2017.0,3.0 , , '' brussels â€” britain must agree to pay its bills and to protect millions of europeans living in britain before reaching a new trading relationship with the european union , donald tusk , the president of the european council , said on friday .
it â€™ s about damage control .
â€ he added that the european union would not pursue a â€œ punitive approach , â€ because â€œ brexit in itself is already punitive enough .
that followed a statement on thursday by chancellor angela merkel of germany that rejected a demand put forth by prime minister theresa may of britain that talks on the withdrawal be conducted in tandem with discussions about economic relations .
the terms , nonetheless , represent an early setback for britain .
the draft guidelines outline a â€œ phased approach â€ that the european union will require britain to follow before talks about any deal on access to the european single market of more than 500 million consumers .
the terms also signaled how britain was losing control over developments in europe by giving spain an effective veto over whether any deal applied to gibraltar , the rocky outcrop that has long been the subject of an acrimonious sovereignty dispute between london and madrid .
market access is a british priority that took on added urgency this week , as mrs. may â€™ s formal notification on wednesday started a clock to reach an agreement .
that time constraint limits british leverage in the negotiations because it would face a welter of tariffs and customs barriers if a deal is not struck during that period .
ms. merkel and president franÃ§ois hollande of france have insisted that london first agree on how to protect the rights of more than about three million expatriates in britain , and more than one million british citizens living in continental europe , and on the amount of money britain owes to cover its commitments as a member of the bloc .
european officials underlined the need to safeguard the rights of expatriates by referring to them in the opening paragraphs of the guidelines .
the leaving bill could be roughly 60 billion euros , or $ 64 billion , according to the european union authorities , and that sum is already a major sticking point .
striking a deal will be fiendishly complex , and there are hazards for both sides .
yet they are extremely wary of britain turning itself into a haven with weakened regulations that would undercut european neighbors .
the european parliament also has a final say over any deal reached with britain .
â€œ cherry picking is over for the united kingdom , and we will defend the interests of the 440 million e. u. citizens when negotiating with the u. k . â€ ''

â€ mr. gordhan , after a stint as finance minister from 2009 to 2014 , was reappointed to the job in december 2015 , after mr. zuma abruptly replaced his successor , nhlanhla nene , with a junior lawmaker .
he also clashed with a powerful family , the guptas , who are close to mr. zuma and are so influential that mr. zuma was obliged to publicly insist last year that he was in charge of his government .

2225,19769 , how does populism turn authoritarian ?
populism does not always end in authoritarianism .
venezuela â€™ s collapse has been aided by other factors , including plummeting oil prices , and democratic institutions can check populism â€™ s darker tendencies .
â€ in mr. chÃ¡vez â€™ s telling , this meant a judiciary that was more responsive to the will and needs of the people â€” a message that may have appealed to supporters who had voted him into office on explicit promises of smashing the corrupt old elite â€™ s hold on power .
cas mudde , a dutch political scientist , wrote in a 2015 column for the guardian that â€œ populism is an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism .
that message was popular , as were initial steps .
that requires handing power to unelected institutions , which are necessary to preserve democracy but at odds with the image of pure popular will .
this is why populists often cultivate cults of personality .
populism â€™ s authoritarian tendencies could be seen in mr. chÃ¡vez â€™ s early battles with labor unions , which he had entered office promising to â€œ democratize .
mr. chÃ¡vez also began exercising more direct control over the powerful oil company , a further extension of his message that power had to be taken back for the people .
these episodes show how initial populist steps â€” standing up to unelected institutions , paving the way for seemingly necessary reforms â€” can take on a momentum of their own , until the list of populist enemies has grown to include pillars of basic democracy .
that progression was not inevitable .
italy â€™ s silvio berlusconi , for example , left office with a mixed record and a storm of corruption charges , but with the country â€™ s democracy intact .
but it is rarely obvious at the time which path a country is taking , and not only because initial steps toward authoritarianism often look or feel democratic .
tom pepinsky , a political scientist at cornell university , has argued that authoritarianism is often an unintended consequence of structural factors that weaken institutions â€” such as an armed conflict or economic shock â€” and of incremental steps taken by leaders who may earnestly believe they are serving popular will .
venezuela exhibits the outcome of populist governance , in which institutions have been so crippled that crime is rampant , corruption is nearly universal and the quality of life has collapsed .
but those consequences are obvious only after they have done their damage . ''
since october , venezuela â€™ s currency , the bolÃ­var , has been in free fall , with the dollar rising against it by 350 percent at its height , putting food even further out of reach and sinking the president â€™ s popularity .
the police raided their home and office , leaving with computer equipment .
but that was no preparation for what would happen after the protesters â€™ harassment of mr. maduro that night in september .
that week the opposition had amassed an estimated one million people in caracas to protest food shortages and demand his ouster .
â€œ it â€™ s about protecting free speech .
â€ the government ombudsman did not respond to a request for comment on mr. jatar or other prisoners .
venezuela â€™ s military and prosecutor â€™ s office also did not respond to a written request for comment .

like his contemporaries andy warhol and roy lichtenstein , mr. rosenquist developed a powerful graphic style in the early 1960s that traditionalists reviled and a broad public enthusiastically embraced .
the pop artists took for their subject matter images and objects from the mass media and popular culture , including advertising , comic books and consumer products .
they also employed techniques that until then had been associated primarily with commercial and industrial methods of production , like silk screening or , in mr. rosenquist â€™ s case , billboard painting .
mr. rosenquist himself drew on his experience painting immense movie billboards above times square and a hebrew national sign in brooklyn .
it was while working in new york as a sign painter by day and an abstract painter by night that he had the idea to import the broadly painted representational pictures from outdoor advertising into the realm of fine art .
â€œ so were warhol â€™ s photo and lichtenstein â€™ s limning of panels from comic strips .
â€œ the goal in all cases , â€ mr. schjeldahl added , â€œ was to fuse painting aesthetics with the semiotics of contemporary reality .
the naked efficiency of artmaking defines classic pop .
it â€™ s as if someone were inviting you to inspect the fist with which he simultaneously punches you .
â€ mr. rosenquist drew inspiration , too , from the tradition of surrealistic collage , as well as from the montage designs of contemporary advertising , to create disjunctive compositions of cropped and fragmented images of cars , movie stars , food products and domestic appliances .
â€œ the art â€™ s formal ingenuity can jump out at you as forcefully as the grill of a ford or a fragment of marilyn monroe â€™ s lips or the cap from a pepsi bottle or a stack of fiesta dishes in a dish rack , â€ michael kimmelman wrote in the new york times , also in 2003 .
mr. rosenquist meant to sell the painting as separate panels , but the collector robert scull bought it whole and kept it that way .
james albert rosenquist was born in grand forks , n. d. on nov. 29 , 1933 , and grew up in various towns in minnesota and ohio before his parents settled in minneapolis in 1944 .
his father , louis , was an airplane mechanic , among other things .
mr. rosenquist studied art at the university of minnesota from 1952 to 1954 , and during his summer vacation in 1953 he worked for a contractor painting gas station signs , storage tanks and grain silos .
he studied there with will barnet , edwin dickinson and george grosz , among others .
he also began frequenting the cedar tavern in greenwich village , a gathering place for painters and poets .
â€œ there was bill de kooning , franz kline , â€ mr. rosenquist told the times in 2003 .
after leaving school the next year , he held a series of odd jobs before returning to sign painting , joining the sign painters union and working mostly for the artkraft strauss sign corporation , which painted some of the largest billboards in the world .
â€œ i painted pieces of bread , arrow shirts , movie stars .
it was very interesting .
i thought this is where the school of mural painting exists .
that year he rented the former studio of agnes martin at coenties slip , a building on the east river in lower manhattan where robert indiana , ellsworth kelly , jasper johns and jack youngerman also had studios .
during the course of his career , mr. rosenquist experimented with sculptural assemblage and environmental installations , and he sometimes attached objects to his pictures .
mr. rosenquist â€™ s first solo exhibition , at the green gallery in 1962 , sold out .
in 1965 , he showed â€œ â€ in his first exhibition at the leo castelli gallery , which by then represented most of major pop artists .
the painting was subsequently exhibited at the jewish museum and then taken on a tour or europe .
for many years he worked out of a loft building on chambers street that he bought in 1977 for $ 120 , 000 .
â€œ another guy would have had a tougher time bouncing back .
â€ mr. rosenquist also had homes in bedford , n. y. and miami .
reviewing it in the new york times , dwight garner called it â€œ a ruddy and humble book , lighted from within by the author â€™ s plainspoken , charm .
â€œ pop art .

now , after britain as a whole voted to leave the european union while scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain , ms. sturgeon is patiently laying out a path for another independence referendum , using prime minister theresa may as her foil .
but hardly warm .
â€ that was hardly unexpected , ms. sturgeon admitted .
â€œ it would have been naÃ¯ve on my part â€ not to factor in mrs. may â€™ s refusal to countenance a referendum before the process of britain â€™ s departure from europe , or brexit , is finished , she said .
but ms. sturgeon intends to press ahead , promising to tell her parliament in april of plans to keep up momentum for what she calls â€œ an act of democratic â€ noting that mrs. may cited the same principle to explain britain â€™ s vote to leave the european union .
it will be for those living in scotland to decide , she insisted , not the parliament in london .
but while scots voted to remain in the european union last june by 62 percent to 38 percent , that has not translated easily into support for independence , with about a third of those favoring independence also voting for a british exit .
â€œ brexit to me is like going back in time , but nobody â€™ s certain about anything just now .
â€ she would not want another referendum so soon in any case , he said , and can now blame mrs. may and westminster , always a popular tactic here .
and while scotland wants to preserve free trade with the european union , it must also keep free trade with the rest of britain too , which in 2015 represented 63 percent of scotland â€™ s trade , compared with 16 percent with the rest of the european union .
since 2014 , scotland â€™ s oil and gas revenues have plunged precipitously , from some 9 .

mr. caughman was his only victim .
on saturday , mayor bill de blasio spoke for 17 minutes at mount zion , towering over the pulpit and over mr. caughman â€™ s garlanded coffin .

officers are trained to hold their fire when possible , especially when confronting people wielding knives and showing signs of mental illness , and to engage them in conversation when commands of â€œ drop the knife â€ don â€™ t work .
this sometimes requires backing up to a safer distance .

an early sign that chief thomson â€™ s message was taking hold among his officers came on nov. 9 , 2015 , when a man walked into a crown fried chicken , behaved menacingly toward customers and employees , brandished a steak knife and left .
the crisis ended when the man did just that .
sgt .
but he is an unlikely reformer .
but the city fell into a long decline .
today there are glimmers of optimism .
the number of homicides in camden has dropped significantly since 2012 , when the city recorded 67 , the most on record last year , the total was 44 .
it was a maneuver that lowered salaries and pension obligations .

the agreements totaled about $ 13 million .
they have complained about a wide range of behavior , including verbal abuse , lewd comments , unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if mr. o â€™ reilly was masturbating , according to documents and interviews .
the three other settlements were uncovered by the times .
a former regular guest on his show , wendy walsh , told the times that after she rebuffed an advance from him he didn â€™ t follow through on a verbal offer to secure her a lucrative position at the network .
â€œ notwithstanding the fact that no current or former fox news employee ever took advantage of the 21st century fox hotline to raise a concern about bill o â€™ reilly , even anonymously , we have looked into these matters over the last few months and discussed them with mr. o â€™ reilly .
â€ according to legal experts , companies occasionally settle disputes that they believe have little merit because it is less risky than taking the matters to trial , which can be costly and create a string of embarrassing headlines .
mr. ailes , who has denied the allegations against him , received $ 40 million as part of his exit package .
the company has reached settlements with at least six women who accused mr. ailes of sexual harassment , according to a person briefed on the agreements .
he earns an annual salary of about $ 18 million as the host of â€œ the o â€™ reilly factor .
â€ every weeknight at 8 p. m. he presents a pugnacious , viewpoint and a fervent strain of patriotism that appeals to conservative viewers .
from 2014 through 2016 , the show generated more than $ 446 million in advertising revenues , according to the research firm kantar media .
this is a sensitive time for fox news as it continues to deal with the fallout of the ailes scandal .
most spoke on the condition of anonymity , citing confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation .
the times also examined more than 100 pages of documents and court filings related to the complaints .
and so i have put to rest any controversies to spare my children .
those of us in the arena are constantly at risk , as are our families and children .
the case did not involve sexual harassment .
in the suit , she said he had told her to buy a vibrator , called her at times when it sounded as if he was masturbating and described sexual fantasies involving her .
â€œ but these people picked the wrong guy .
the goal was to depict her as a promiscuous woman , deeply in debt , who was trying to shake down mr. o â€™ reilly , according to people briefed on the strategy .
after two weeks of sensational headlines , the two sides settled , and mr. o â€™ reilly agreed to pay ms. mackris about $ 9 million , according to people briefed on the agreement .
similar to ms. mackris , she had recorded conversations with mr. o â€™ reilly , according to people familiar with the case .
the exact amount of the payout is not known .
in the aftermath of mr. ailes â€™ s ouster last summer , as 21st century fox was completing settlements and trying to put the scandal behind it , it reached deals with two women who had complained about sexual harassment by mr. o â€™ reilly .
in response , 21st century fox reached a settlement with her for over $ 1 million , according to a person briefed on the agreement .
in september , 21st century fox reached a settlement worth $ 1 .
6 million with juliet huddy , who had made regular appearances on mr. o â€™ reilly â€™ s show , according to people familiar with the matter .
â€ the letter , which was obtained by the times , said that if she were to follow through with a claim against mr. o â€™ reilly , he would pursue legal action â€œ to hold ms. huddy , and all who have assisted her , personally liable for any damage suffered by him or his family .
fox news is now in a legal battle with ms. tantaros , the former personality who is suing the network and mr. ailes after turning down a settlement offer of nearly $ 1 million .
â€ ms. walsh , the former guest on â€œ the o â€™ reilly factor , â€ told the times she was propositioned by mr. o â€™ reilly in 2013 but did not lodge a complaint because she did not want to harm her career prospects .
he also told her that her black leather purse was ugly .
ms. mackris â€™ s settlement prevents her from talking about fox news and her dispute with mr. o â€™ reilly , according to people briefed on the deal .
today , ms. mackris lives with her cats in an condo in her hometown , st. louis , where she keeps bowls of colorful gumballs on tabletops .

2249,19795 , ancestral climates may have shaped your nose - the new york times , new york times , steph yin,2017-04-02,2017.0,4.0 , , '' ask anyone what the nose does , and the reply will most likely be related to smell .
in cold , dry climates , natural selection may have favored noses that were better at heating and moisturizing air .
they looked at four regions â€” west africa , east asia , northern europe and south asia â€” with at least 40 participants in each group .
correlations between nostril width and climate were strongest for northern europeans , the researchers found , suggesting that cold , dry climates in particular may have favored people with narrower nostrils .
that may indicate that other factors are involved in what kinds of noses are passed down , he said , such as â€œ cultural differences in what is considered an attractive nose or not .
in actuality , the genes that differ because of geographic origin , such as those affecting skin color , hair texture and nose shape , are the rare exception , rather than the rule .

though no clear explanation was given at the time , recent interviews with former and current staff members reveal that ms. coburn had long complained that she was unable to do her job effectively because of a close personal relationship between mr. campbell and a female staff member in her department .
mr. campbell announced his resignation in february .
despite its vaunted collection , prodigious $ 332 million budget and a board stocked with some of the country â€™ s most powerful donors , the met is largely run by a dozen or so executives and trustees , interviews show , with little transparency or accountability .
the recent discovery of a looming $ 40 million deficit that forced the institution to cut staff , trim its exhibition schedule and postpone a heralded $ 600 million expansion are signs that the system is showing cracks .
ms. coburn filed a formal complaint in 2012 .
met executives investigated her claims but concluded they didn â€™ t warrant action .
neither the staff member nor mr. campbell responded to requests for comment .
at a recent board meeting the met agreed to examine the job descriptions of president and director .

â€œ april is a tough reporter who knows how to throw it out and take it back , â€ mr. spicer said in an interview with the radio host hugh hewitt .

the broad review announced monday could threaten some of those decrees if the justice department seeks to change its past stance about systematic police abuses in the affected agencies .
but the justice department would not be able to unilaterally unwind the agreements without court intervention .
the review culminated in august , when the justice department issued a blistering report that found that the baltimore police had engaged in a â€œ pattern and practice â€ of discrimination that systematically violated the civil rights of black residents .
in january , days before mr. obama left office , mayor pugh and the justice department signed a broad blueprint for an overhaul .

republicans vowed monday to confirm him by the end of the week .
that would require eight democrats to join the republican majority .
as of monday evening , only four democrats had announced support for an vote .
â€ such was the theme of monday â€™ s proceedings : a series of meditations on grand traditions , a resignation to their imminent demise and an insistence that the other side was to blame .
but democrats insist that their opposition to judge gorsuch is not about payback .
they have cited his record on workers â€™ rights and his degree of independence from mr. trump and conservative groups like the federalist society , among other concerns .
perhaps no member sounded as pained on monday as senator patrick j. leahy , democrat of vermont and the senate â€™ s member .
mr. leahy suggested that mr. mcconnell had no qualms about â€œ forever damaging the united states senate .
that shift left the filibuster for supreme court nominations untouched .
( before the election , he had suggested trying to leave the seat open indefinitely if hillary clinton won . )
â€ every senate race , he added , would effectively become a referendum on the supreme court .
the room appeared split .
â€œ could the majority cater this lunch ? â€ asked senator al franken , democrat of minnesota .
senator mitch mcconnell , republican of kentucky and the majority leader , promised on sunday that judge gorsuch would be confirmed this week , even if it required changing longstanding senate practice to require only a simple majority vote .
here is an assessment of claims from democratic and republican lawmakers .
it takes only a majority , 51 votes , to confirm a nominee .
but under current senate rules , ending debate or a filibuster over a supreme court nominee â€” called a cloture vote â€” requires a majority .
â€ in three other cases , they chose not to filibuster , but the nominees failed the vote .
why does this matter ?
in 2013 , the senate majority leader at the time , harry reid , â€œ went nuclear â€ and reduced the cloture threshold for all other judicial and executive nominees to a simple majority .
â€œ you â€™ re seeing hardball tactics in the senate accompanied by hardball language dressed up as procedural nuance .
nine democrats and three republicans did not vote .
his nomination was then withdrawn .
the filibuster was technically bipartisan , with 19 democrats voting against cloture .
filibusters are not always a factor in unsuccessful nominations .
â€œ that â€™ s what happened with harriet miers , bush ii â€™ s nominee .
â€ this is misleading judge gorsuch had long exchanges with senator richard blumenthal , democrat of connecticut , about the school desegregation case during his hearings .

2263,19811 , senate judiciary committee approves gorsuch in party-line vote - the new york times , new york times , matt flegenheimer,2017-04-04,2017.0,4.0 , , '' â–  the senate judiciary committee , in a vote , sent the nomination of judge neil m. gorsuch for the supreme court to the full senate for consideration .
â–  but republicans will most likely vote to change senate practices later in the week so that judge gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority vote .
â–  the tenor of the judiciary committee strongly suggests that the full senate debate on judge gorsuch will be even more contentious .

â€œ he â€™ s a picture of the kind of justice we should have on the supreme court .
she did thank mr. grassley for overseeing the hearings fairly .
in his own comments , mr. grassley expressed no regrets .
few sounded as aggrieved as senator patrick j. leahy , democrat of vermont and the body â€™ s member .
and their intentions seem clear .
â€œ what i can tell you is that neil gorsuch will be confirmed this week , â€ mr. mcconnell told chuck todd on nbc â€™ s â€œ meet the press .
â€ practically , this will almost certainly require republicans to change senate practice and elevate judge gorsuch on a simple majority vote .
â€ mr. mcconnell chose to forgo analogies .

what is a filibuster ?
by exploiting the chamber â€™ s rules for full debate on an issue , the minority can indefinitely obstruct something that has majority support .
according to the senate historical office , the term traces back to a dutch word meaning â€œ pirate .
if any senators refuse to consent to holding an vote on judge gorsuch â€™ s nomination , the senate has to decide whether to overrule them .
this is what mr. mcconnell has threatened if democrats muster enough votes to filibuster judge gorsuch .
by a simple majority , republicans would change the senate â€™ s rules to abolish the ability of a minority to filibuster supreme court confirmation votes .
no .
but they left the filibuster rule intact for supreme court nominations and for legislation .
no , they are only an artifact of senate rules .
but in 1917 , amid acrimonious arguments over whether the united states should take part in world war i , it created the cloture rule to provide a mechanism for a supermajority of 67 senators to cut off debate and proceed to a final vote .
in 1975 , the senate reduced the supermajority requirement to 60 votes .
no .
that â€™ s called a talking filibuster , and it is the image created by the 1939 frank capra movie â€œ mr .
the record for the longest such filibuster speech is held by senator strom thurmond of south carolina , who was then a democrat but later became a republican .
he â€™ s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation .
if egypt can be a partner in the battle against international terrorism , then in mr. trump â€™ s calculation , that is more important to the united states than concerns over its brutal suppression of domestic dissent .
â€œ he took control of egypt .
mr. sisi has rejected suggestions that he rules like a dictator .
egyptians also often mock mr. sisi for speaking in a rustic form of arabic that contrasts with the formal version usually favored by national leaders .
3 billion in military assistance .
one thing mr. sisi desperately wants , according to western officials in cairo , is for mr. trump to reinstate a military financing deal , suspended under mr. obama in 2015 , allowing egypt to effectively buy , on credit , the tanks , warplanes and other military items it desires .

at both easter and passover , the meal is more than just food .
at easter , the simnel cake is decorated with 11 balls of marzipan to represent all the apostles minus judas .
the lamb represents abraham â€™ s sacrifice of his son , and christ â€™ s sacrifice of his own life .
at passover , flat matzo , rather than regular leavened bread , recalls how the jews were forced to leave egypt in such a hurry that there was no time to wait for their bread to rise .
bitter herbs stand for suffering .
my own favorite as a child was my italian grandmother â€™ s haroseth .
tucking into a slice of simnel cake at that easter lunch â€” as rich and dense with dried fruit and nuts as my grandmother â€™ s hedgehog haroseth â€” was a powerful madeleine moment .
we haven â€™ t yet done a proper seder meal for our children in london .
when we do , though , we will be seating the easter bunny alongside the hedgehog .
the casatiello is an easter bread steeped in neapolitan tradition .
my grandmother may have been italian , but she certainly wouldn â€™ t have been baking with flour for her seder meal , nor serving pork products ( at any time of the year ) .
intended more for the passover table , then , is the walnut cake .

dozens of people , including children , died â€” some writhing , choking , gasping or foaming at the mouth â€” after breathing in poison that possibly contained a nerve agent or other banned chemicals , according to witnesses , doctors and rescue workers .
the bodies of at least 10 children lay lined up on the ground or under a quilt .
the attack also seemed likely to dampen peace talks that have been overseen by the united nations in geneva and by russia and turkey in astana , kazakhstan .
incredulous over the chemical assault , humanitarian groups demanded action from the united nations security council , where partisan divides over who is to blame for the syrian war have paralyzed its members almost since the conflict began in 2011 .
the draft resolution , negotiated among diplomats from the three countries on tuesday , was later circulated to all 15 members of the council .
the white house called the attack a â€œ reprehensible â€ act against innocent people â€œ that can not be ignored by the civilized world .
but in august 2013 , mr. trump exhorted mr. obama not to intervene after a chemical weapons attack near damascus that american intelligence attributed to the syrian military killed more than 1 , 400 civilians , including hundreds of children , according to united states government estimates at the time .
â€œ there is no upside and tremendous downside .
â€ mr. tillerson added that â€œ russia and iran also bear great moral responsibility for these deaths .
chlorine attacks usually kill just a few people , often those trapped in an enclosed space , and the gas dissipates quickly .
the attack appeared to be the deadliest chemical attack in syria since the august 2013 assault .
under threat of united states retaliation , mr. assad agreed to a deal to eliminate his country â€™ s chemical weapons program , which until that time it had denied having , and to join an international treaty banning chemical weapons .
a chemical weapons attack , if carried out by the government , would be a brazen statement of impunity , coming during a major international meeting in brussels where officials are debating whether the european union and other countries will contribute billions of dollars for reconstructing syria if it is presided over by a government run by mr .

following an investigation by the new york times over the weekend that revealed multiple settlements over allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior by mr. o â€™ reilly , the network faced a major advertising revolt as more than a dozen marketers said that they were withdrawing their ads from â€œ the o â€™ reilly factor .

mr. o â€™ reilly earns about $ 18 million a year .

for some in law enforcement , the message has done what it intended to do : mollify , soothe , inspire .
in the first camp is sheriff michael bouchard of oakland county , outside detroit , who explains the perspective of officers facing hostility and scrutiny by cellphone cameras as they perform a dangerous job .
michael bouchard : i think that police agencies are expecting and capable of handling scrutiny .
but i think that the tone and the rhetoric did in fact diminish it .
â€ it â€™ s a very different kind of vantage .
there are about 18 , 000 police departments in america .
i mean , what you want is proactive policing to question situations , to stop cars , to look for something that is on the precipice of being a crime and interrupt it before it happens .
it â€™ s the job of the chief to tell their folks , â€œ look , if you do your job as you â€™ re trained and as i expect , i will stand behind you .
dr. serpas : yes and no .
in the case of the baltimore police department it â€™ s been my personal experience , from interviewing nearly 100 officers , that the department has not â€œ pulled back .
â€œ we did not take a knee â€ was a constant refrain .
we will likely need more time and information to understand the factors driving this .
now we police that community with about 77 .
dr. serpas : there is no such thing as too much emphasis on community relations and partnerships .
sheriff bouchard : civil rights investigations are routinely undertaken by the department of justice , and we â€™ re not suggesting that they stop , but the approach that â€œ virtually every department is broken â€ has been a frustrating dialogue .
and if there was wrongdoing , people will be held accountable .
but we all know this may not be the case in every local government .
it is our federal constitution that establishes what the requirements of policing are in this nation . ''
we examined the probable effects when the idea surfaced in april .
now that those ideas have become part of the legislative package , we â€™ ve updated our analysis .
throughout the debate to repeal and replace the affordable care act , president trump and republican congressional leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial , popular part of the health law : the promise that people can buy insurance even if they â€™ ve had illnesses in the past .
but now , the bill appears back from the dead , because of a compromise meant to attract votes from the conservative freedom caucus .
because they help people with substantial health care needs buy relatively affordable coverage , they drive up the price of insurance for people who are healthy .
â€œ those that have , you know , premiums that would be driven up because of catastrophic illness or illnesses , we â€™ ve been dealing with that for a long time with pools .
in recent months , the law has grown more popular , and the conditions policy is among its protections .
shifting norms about health insurance regulation may also affect the idea â€™ s reception in congress .
the version of the health bill currently under discussion would retain the conditions policy .
the result could be a world where people with conditions would struggle to buy comprehensive health insurance â€” just like before obamacare . ''

6 billion .
if boeing is forbidden to sell the aircraft to iran , plane makers in other countries might fill the gap .
last month , the united states imposed sanctions on 25 iranian entities and individuals over what the white house called illegal iranian missile tests .
boeing officials did not immediately return emailed requests for comment .
the announcement , posted on boeing â€™ s website , said aseman intended to buy 30 boeing 737 max aircraft valued at $ 3 billion , with rights to purchase an additional 30 .

the boeing deal requires permission from the office of foreign assets control of the treasury department , which has regulatory authority over such transactions with iran .

the increasing difficulty of reading small print that begins in middle age is called presbyopia , from the greek words for â€œ old man â€ and â€œ eye .
over age 50 , it â€™ s nearly universal .
the decline in vision is inconvenient , but it â€™ s also dangerous , causing falls and auto accidents .
i â€™ m 45 .
i can still read the the new york times print edition with ease , but to read text in somewhat smaller fonts , i have to strain .
or so i thought .
the training involves looking at images called â€œ gabor patches â€ in various conditions .
a great deal of the training involves trying to see gabor patches placed between closely spaced , distracting flankers .
do this and similar exercises hundreds of times over multiple sessions weekly continue for months and , gradually , presbyopia lessens , a number of studies show .
they â€™ re all in the brain .
for example , a study tested the approach in 23 young adults , around age 24 .
it may also improve vision in those with mild myopia ( nearsightedness ) .
however , other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results , and several scientists i spoke to , including those without ties to glassesoff , thought the science behind the app was credible .
visual processing time is challenged and slowed by noisy images , low contrast or closely spaced information ( like small fonts ) .
what â€™ s surprising is that this is possible in adult brains .
neuroplasticity â€” the ability of the brain â€™ s processing functions to change to acquire new skills â€” is most strongly associated with childhood .
but weeks into it , i began to dread the monotonous labor .
if i reach 50 â€” the age at which almost everyone needs corrective lenses to read â€” and still don â€™ t need reading glasses , i may conclude that the training has paid off .
upon completion , i was invited to pay another $ 59 .
the confession and resignation shed light on a nearly mystery .
the fed conducted an inconclusive investigation into the source of the leak .
â€œ dr .
( mr. lacker has a doctorate in economics from the university of wisconsin . )
it is not clear whether any other investigations are in progress .
on oct. 3 , a day before the fed released an account of its deliberations , regina schleiger , a medley analyst , sent a note to clients saying the fed was likely to announce in december that it would buy treasuries too .
the information was accurate and valuable .
â€ he added , â€œ i deeply regret the role i may have played .
â€ after the leak , the c. f. t. c. pursued an investigation under its â€œ eddie murphy rule .
â€ this rule was a nod to mr. murphy â€™ s 1983 movie â€œ trading places , â€ which humorously exposed the legality of insider trading in commodities .
he acknowledged speaking with her multiple times .
mr. lacker , 61 , was the member of the fed â€™ s committee .
he became president of the richmond fed in august 2004 .
he had previously announced that he planned to resign in october .
â€ ''
he has been called a narcissist .
lately , he has been spending time at a florida resort named .
guo wengui .
at the very least , it would be embarrassing if mr. guo , who is also known as miles kwok , were to show up at the seaside resort during the meeting thursday and friday .
mr. guo said his assets in china â€” he puts the figure at more than $ 17 billion â€” were seized .
but mr. ling has stayed quiet and kept his whereabouts secret .
china has more billionaires than any other country with the possible exception of the united states , but none as outspoken and flamboyant as mr. guo .
but mr. guo is anything but .
chinese billionaires living abroad are not immune to the long reach of beijing â€™ s security apparatus .
mr. guo was in london last week at the prestigious mark â€™ s club in mayfair , which requires men to wear jackets â€œ at all times .
earlier in march , he was at posing for pictures .
during his stay , he also visited an episcopal church that the trumps attend , and spent some time at an elegant beachside home , decorated with an asian motif and featured in architectural digest that is now owned by a limited liability company tied to victor vargas , a venezuelan banker .
â€œ i â€™ m feeling a lot of emotion .
but i admire his persistent character .

mr. xi was in finland when the test was carried out .

that test was considered a failure , with the projectile exploding within seconds of launching , according to american and south korean defense authorities .
largely because of north korea â€™ s missile and nuclear tests and mr. kim â€™ s bellicose talk , the government in seoul agreed to a united states proposal to put an antimissile system in south korea .
the only group the father of three has ever belonged to , however , is jehovah â€™ s witnesses , a christian denomination committed to the belief that the bible must be taken literally , particularly its injunction â€œ thou shalt not kill .
â€ whether it stays there will depend on russia â€™ s supreme court , which is scheduled to meet on wednesday to hear a request from the justice ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170 , 000 russian members from spreading â€œ extremist â€ texts .
extremism , as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since , has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody , as it has been against some of those involved in recent protests in moscow and scores of other cities .
he added that while he had not voted since , nor had he supported activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of russia â€™ s version of the k. g. b. the federal security service , or f. s. b .
â€ she added , â€œ they don â€™ t get involved in politics , but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation .
that the worldwide headquarters of jehovah â€™ s witnesses is in the united states and that its publications are mostly prepared there , ms. fagan added , â€œ all adds up to a big conspiracy theory â€ for the increasingly assertive f. s. b .
for mr. sivak , it has added up to a long legal nightmare .
accused of â€œ inciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens , â€ he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder , vyacheslav stepanov , 40 .
vasily kalin , the chairman of jehovah â€™ s witnesses â€™ russian arm , recalled that his whole family had been deported to siberia when he was a child .
they are pacifists , so they can not be radicalized , no matter what you do to them .
â€ attacking jehovah â€™ s witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm , if proclaimed publicly and insistently , can be punished under the law , which was passed after russia â€™ s second war in chechnya and the sept. 11 attacks in the united states .
even the russian orthodox church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law : the slogan â€œ orthodoxy or death ! â€ â€” a rallying cry embraced by some believers â€” has been banned as an illegal extremist text .

the decision by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit , the highest federal court yet to grant such employment protections , raises the chances that the politically charged issue may ultimately be resolved by the supreme court .
the case stems from a lawsuit by kimberly hively , an indiana teacher who has alleged that she was fired from ivy tech community college because she is a lesbian .
she applied to six jobs at the school in south bend , ind .
the community college denies that she was discriminated against because of her sexual orientation .
â€œ hively â€™ s claim is no different from the claims brought by women who were rejected for jobs in traditionally male workplaces , such as fire departments , construction and policing , â€ the court â€™ s chief judge , diane p. wood , wrote in the opinion .
â€ the court did not rule on ms. hively â€™ s specific lawsuit .
greg nevins , the employment fairness program director for lambda legal , which represented ms. hively , called the ruling a â€œ tremendous victory .
lawyers with the firm barnes thornburg , which is representing ivy tech , did not immediately return phone calls or respond to emails .
in another case involving sexual orientation and the federal civil rights law , an employee at georgia regional hospital in savannah claimed that she was essentially forced out of her security guard job because she is a lesbian .
a panel in the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit ruled last month that the law did not apply to her .
a federal judge dismissed the case , which was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit .
a panel ruled last week against the employee , but the chief judge , robert a. katzmann , noted that legal and societal views had shifted on legal protections and rights for gay people .
â€œ other federal courts are also grappling with this question , and it well may be that the supreme court will ultimately address it , â€ he wrote .

the national football league has reached an agreement with amazon to allow amazon prime customers to stream 10 â€œ thursday night football â€ games in the coming season , n. f. l. and amazon representatives said .
amazon agreed to pay about $ 50 million for the streaming rights to the n. f. l. games , according to a person briefed on the deal who asked for anonymity because the price was confidential .
the amount was about five times the roughly $ 10 million twitter agreed to pay the n. f. l. last year for streaming rights to â€œ thursday night football , â€ this person said .
amazon and netflix are pouring money into their video services , both licensing content and producing original programming .
agreements with amazon and other internet companies are an attempt by the n. f. l. to reach younger fans , even though the league risks alienating the broadcast networks that pay hundreds of millions of dollars in rights fees .
amazon will stream games produced by either cbs or nbc , which air the games on television .
the thursday night games will also air on nfl network , the league â€™ s cable channel .
the television audience for â€œ thursday night football â€ dwarfed the internet audience during last season â€™ s experiment on twitter .

the report , published tuesday by the centers for disease control and prevention , also provided more evidence that the risk of birth defects was greater when women were infected in the first trimester of pregnancy .
â€œ but you can â€™ t take away from this , â€˜ oh , as long as i â€™ m not infected in the first trimester , it will be fine .
some of the women were infected by mosquitoes in the continental united states , but all 51 cases of birth defects reported in the study were traced to infections acquired in one of 16 countries or territories in latin america or the caribbean , including puerto rico .
that is because researchers may not have been aware of all the asymptomatic zika cases : some women without symptoms may not have gotten tested for zika , and consequently , their cases would not be reported .
birth defects , ranging from the condition of abnormally small heads , known as microcephaly , to neural tube defects and eye malformations , occurred in 5 percent , or 51 , of those pregnancies , including 45 live births .
the rest were missing information on the timing of infection .

most of that condemnation is richly deserved .

hunger is associated with desire , whereas thirst is associated with need .
it reframes a basic , need as a moral , social , aesthetic and personal failure .
â€œ thirsty â€ is a unisex but that doesn â€™ t mean it â€™ s not gendered .

the united states , france and britain have accused the syrian government of responsibility and bitterly criticized russia â€” syria â€™ s main ally in the war â€” for objecting to a resolution they drafted condemning the attack .
russia has said that insurgents may have been responsible , or that the attack may have been fabricated to embarrass president bashar of syria .
â€œ when the united nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively , there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action , â€ she said .
she did not provide further details .
but the hint of acting alone was striking , suggesting that she was willing to articulate a position even before her boss .

the brussels conference produced pledges of $ 6 billion for 2017 , christos stylianides , the european commissioner for humanitarian aid , announced wednesday evening when the meeting concluded .
the united states put the blame for the attack on the syrian government and its patrons , russia and iran , and suggested that the salvo was a war crime .
according to the violations documentation center , an antigovernment watchdog , more than 1 , 100 syrians have been killed in chemical weapons and gas attacks .
hundreds of thousands of people there and in other besieged cities risked starving to death , and many hundreds succumbed to the stranglehold that forces loyal to mr. assad had on the city â€™ s food supply .
in september , after the assad government agreed to allow international aid convoys to enter aleppo , russian or syrian warplanes attacked the trucks , killing about 20 people and leading to a suspension in aid .
rebel forces and the islamic state have also besieged areas on a smaller scale .
inmates are kept under conditions so dismal â€” including regular , severe beatings and deprivation of food , water , medicine and basic sanitation â€” that they amount to deliberate extermination , defined under international law as a crime against humanity , the report said .
airstrikes have also targeted hospitals .

at the end of the opera , to music so full of feeling strauss wanted it played at his own funeral , she accepts the inevitable and graciously surrenders her lover to a younger woman .
it becomes an opera about the end of an era , or even the end of the world .
for renÃ©e fleming , the superstar soprano who will sing the marschallin at the met , and for music , this really is the end of an era : this â€œ rosenkavalier â€ may well be her farewell to staged opera .
she will sing her final performance on the afternoon of saturday , may 13 .
â€œ or , â€˜ i heard her when .
â€” but may really be in peril this time .
not only is opera more divorced than ever from mainstream culture , but also its core audience , the people who buy subscriptions , is literally dying off .
plÃ¡cido domingo , the only singer on her level still performing , is 76 , and , though he keeps defying time , can â€™ t go on forever younger artists like anna netrebko and jonas kaufmann may be but are hardly household names .
â€œ nothing can explain it .
invited to sing david letterman â€™ s top 10 list , and to record , in the original elvish , some of the soundtrack for the third â€œ lord of the rings â€ movie , she gained a following among people who , strictly speaking , weren â€™ t opera buffs at all .
â€œ she wanted to be beyoncÃ© .
but she â€™ s very calm .
â€œ the arc of a career is complicated .
a beautiful woman in every respect .
( nowadays , according to ms. patchett , she dresses up even to go to kinko â€™ s at 8 in the morning . )
she has been called the june cleaver of opera singers â€” too bland , in other words â€” and her voice has been described as botoxed , so plump and seamless that it lacks dramatic expressiveness .
ms. fleming â€™ s sound hasn â€™ t darkened with age , as often happens to sopranos .
and unlike some earlier divas , for whom the job description seemed to include being as difficult offstage as was humanly possible , she is , for a superstar , almost unnaturally normal and unaffected .
â€œ she â€™ s chronically humble .
â€œ renÃ©e was always doing surprising things , â€ ms. schardt recalled .
no .
is it something we were thinking about when we graduated in 1981 ?
no .
she â€™ s a working singer , and these are gigs .
what grounds her is her friends , her family , her girls .
fortunate in her teachers , among them beverley johnson and the imperious elisabeth schwarzkopf , she acquired a formidable mastery of the mechanics of singing .
but even with all her technique â€” or maybe because of it â€” ms. fleming was a late bloomer .
she suffered from stage fright , from poor audition choices and from finding a certain psychological comfort in finishing second rather than first place in competitions .
afterward , she presided over a panel discussion , delving into details about the larynx , the importance of hydration and perhaps more about the vocal mucosa than nonsingers really need to know .
a little more than 24 hours later , as if to prove the soundness of her theories and her own breathing apparatus , ms. fleming took part in a big concert celebrating chicago singing in all its variety .
she sang a debussy art song , a operatic version of â€œ summertime , â€ a sarah vaughan jazz tune in a duet with kurt elling , and , with john prine , a gently twanging version of the nashville song â€œ ( we â€™ re not ) the jet set .
â€ that ms. fleming sang more than any of the other performers doubtless had something to do with the fact that she was the organizer and headliner .
but unlike a lot of singers , she also has the range to perform in that many styles .
â€ what she wants is to keep on singing , a reasonable amount for a reasonable amount of time , and to be a part of whatever happens next .
i just kind of love doing all these different things .

by clearing the deal with european union regulators , china national chemical corporation is close to the $ 43 billion takeover of syngenta , the swiss farm chemical and seed company .
â€œ this is an attempt to upgrade productivity .
bayer ag , the german industrial conglomerate , is also trying to complete its multibillion takeover of monsanto .
that deal would give bayer control of the company most closely associated with the rise of genetically modified foods .
it is an important play for china , which has struggled to maintain and upgrade its food supply in recent years .
although china has poured money into research , it still bans cultivation of genetically modified food for human consumption , and knowledge about genetically modified organisms is limited .
the chemchina deal could bolster china â€™ s efforts to become a major player in genetically modified food .
â€ chemchina will have to sell prized assets to take control of syngenta .
â€œ chemchina has offered significant remedies , which fully address our competition concerns .
â€ the european union granted its approval a day after chemchina received the from the united states federal trade commission .
the committee on foreign investment in the united states , which focuses on national security issues and was also regarded as a significant potential obstacle , cleared the deal in august .
widespread suspicion of genetically modified foods in europe means that protests against monsanto can draw thousands , and several european countries ban their cultivation .
the ability to complete another agricultural chemicals deal , however , could be diminished by the huge deals that have been done .
in recent years , chinese companies have been on an acquisition binge , buying major strategic assets like copper mines and oil deposits , and investing in flashier , if less economically or geopolitically important , deals for marquee names like the waldorf astoria hotel in manhattan .
lately , there have been signs that the shopping spree might be ending .

â€œ guys , tell people to wear masks , â€ he warned .
both parties have warned of sweeping effects on the court itself , predicting the elevation of more ideologically extreme judges now that only a majority is required for confirmation .
but they left the filibuster for supreme court nominees untouched , an acknowledgment of the court â€™ s exalted status .
on thursday , that last pillar was swept away on a vote , with all 52 republicans choosing to overrule senate precedent and all 48 democrats and independents pushing to keep it .
in recent days , faint rumblings of a deal to avert the clash had faded almost entirely .
democrats placed the blame squarely on senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the majority leader , and his republican colleagues , who last year refused to even consider judge merrick b. garland , president barack obama â€™ s nominee for the seat of justice antonin scalia , who died nearly 14 months ago .
â€œ they have had other choices , â€ he added .
â€ lawmakers first convened late thursday morning to decide whether to advance the nomination .
republicans needed 60 votes â€” at least eight democrats and independents joining the majority â€” to end debate on the nomination and proceed to a final vote .
â€œ and it can not and it will not stand .
â€ but democrats had shown no signs of forsaking their filibuster plans all week .
they cited concerns over judge gorsuch â€™ s record on workers â€™ rights and wondered whether he could be reliably independent from mr. trump and conservative groups like the federalist society , which pushed his nomination .
but at times on thursday , it was difficult to escape the conclusion that judge garland loomed largest in the minds of democrats .
â€œ the chair is not aware of any such prohibition in its rules or precedents , â€ replied senator deb fischer , republican of nebraska , who was presiding in the chamber at the time .
for mr. mcconnell , who could be seen doling out among lawmakers and aides after the votes , thursday â€™ s proceedings amounted to a gamble rewarded .
â€œ i just thought it was stupid .
â€œ so there â€™ s plenty more time for more harm to be done .
â€ despair was bipartisan .
â€œ it â€™ s hard to know whether the polarization in the senate reflects the country or whether the polarization and divisiveness in the senate affects the country .

republicans are quick to point out â€” and many democrats privately agree â€” that had former secretary of state hillary clinton won the white house last year and democrats taken the senate , a similar confrontation would have been likely in the other direction , and that democrats might have needed to take the same step republicans took to confirm any supreme court nominee mrs. clinton had chosen .
yes , republicans have labored to promote some of his priorities and look away from his myriad controversies , but they have also shown signs of holding together with democrats toward mutual goals that are not always in concert with mr. trump â€™ s .

mr. mcconnell ultimately agreed to a softer version of the letter , which did not mention the russians but warned of unnamed â€œ malefactors â€ who might seek to disrupt the elections through online intrusion .
the letter , dated sept. 28 , was signed by mr. mcconnell , mr. reid , speaker paul d. ryan and representative nancy pelosi , the ranking democrat .
â€ â€œ at the least , this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election , â€ they added .

yet mr. nunes resisted demands to step aside until thursday , when he found himself under investigation by the house ethics committee .

representative k. michael conaway of texas , a senior republican on the committee , will assume control of the investigation .
mr. gowdy is also on the ethics committee .

â€ the ethics committee comprises 10 house members : five republicans and five democrats .
it is unclear how long the inquiry could take , but the investigations usually last months or years .
as the house investigation has deteriorated into partisan feuding in recent weeks , many have turned to the senate intelligence committee as congress â€™ s last best hope for an impartial congressional investigation into russian interference in the election .
since late july , the f. b. i. has been conducting its own counterintelligence investigation into russian interference in the election , including an examination of whether mr. trump â€™ s associates cooperated with russian officials to influence the race . ''

nor is the united states likely to designate china a currency manipulator , something he promised to do as a candidate .
holding back those moves suggests mr. trump is also heeding the more moderate voices among his advisers , who argue that the united states can not afford to ignite a trade war with china .
â€ mr. xi arrived in florida on thursday afternoon , stepping off his air china flight into the humid air of palm beach .
on thursday evening , he attended a formal dinner at mr. trump â€™ s estate .
but china â€™ s increasing presence in nuclear energy has raised security concerns in some countries . ''
it is a view that is outdated .
mr. trump has similarly assailed the united states trade deficit with china and other countries , often characterizing it as a scorecard , evidence that china is winning at trade and the united states losing , to the tune of $ 310 billion a year .
the reality is more nuanced .
for example , a trade war that significantly reduces american imports from china while also reducing american exports to china would reduce the trade deficit but would mean lower incomes and fewer jobs in both countries .
but the trade gap isn â€™ t driven just by the details of trade arrangements .
it is also driven by the flow of capital between countries .
to oversimplify , when a company sells more abroad than it buys , it has to do something with that money .
the flip side of a current account deficit , as an economist might put it , is a capital account surplus .
that might include pushing china to allow more troubled enterprises to fail , so that their accumulated profits might be spread through the chinese economy instead of funneled toward the purchase of foreign assets .
but resetting economic relations with china will prove trickier than any real estate deal .
the leverage that each side has to deploy is limited â€” at least so long as neither country is willing to shoot itself in the foot .
â€ mr. trump likes to announce big splashy deals , and given that the chinese are looking for places to invest their capital in the united states , it would be easy enough to find something along those lines to announce .
but in the context of the two giant economies , that kind of thing is small bore .

â€œ the children of officials did what they were told .
many of the first red guards who embraced mao â€™ s call in august 1966 to purge society of ideological enemies and traitors were the children of party officials .
radicals accused students at the school of betraying mao by defending their parents and privileges .
a journal published by red guards described the school as â€œ a cradle for pampering the sons of senior cadres â€ that had â€œ bred a successor class of the bourgeoisie .
â€ violence was encouraged and widespread .
in august and september of 1966 , nearly 1 , 800 people died in attacks across beijing , according to party estimates issued in 1980 .
mr. xi â€™ s father , exiled in central china , was seized by red guards , who took him to xi â€™ an , a city in northwest china .

mr. trump had looked back on mr. obama â€™ s decision not to carry out a strike and decided that the united states â€œ could not yet again turn away , turn a blind eye , â€ mr. tillerson added .
and that reaction propelled him into a sequence of actions that will change the course of his presidency .
â€œ it is now my responsibility .

residents in the city of homs , near al shayrat airfield , which was hit with dozens of tomahawk missiles in the predawn hours on friday local time , praised the strike .
â€œ we will not kneel !
small children later joined the protesters , and the group was filmed standing silently in a circle , carrying pictures of the victims of the attack .
â€œ we â€™ re feeling some relief now .
â€œ this is a tranquilizer shot .
if you really want to put an end to the suffering , hit all the airports .
he urged the united states to launch â€œ tomahawks on all the airports of death , the airports of killing and extermination and displacement in syria .
â€ â€œ praise god , â€ he added .
â€œ children are choking and dying .
entire families are dying .
â€ wissam zarqa , an english teacher from the northern city of aleppo who now lives in idlib province , called the missile strike a positive step .
â€œ we hope more steps would follow to punish assad for all attacks against civilians , whether chemical or not .
â€ malek al shimali , an activist displaced from his home in aleppo a few months ago and now staying in turkey , expressed mixed feelings about the missile strike .

the war has also entangled russia and the united states , and sent shock waves through europe , which streams of syrian refugees have fled to .
that angered some allies .
israel , saudi arabia and others accused him of overlooking aggressive moves by iran in order to clinch a deal to limit its nuclear program .
â€œ everyone here in khan sheikhoun is happy .
â€œ is it enough ?
i don â€™ t reckon it is enough .
russia has argued that the deaths in khan sheikhoun on tuesday occurred when a bomb hit a chemical weapons facility belonging to the rebels .
â€œ there were a lot of mixed emotions , â€ she added .
â€œ they were worried about what this means , yet at the same time incredibly relieved and happy that someone is finally standing up for them against assad .
â€ the strikes did not appear to have significantly degraded the ability of mr. assad and his allies to wage war .

â€ facing stiff opposition in congress , mr. obama unexpectedly said he would hold off on military action to instead pursue an international agreement to destroy syria â€™ s stockpile of chemical weapons .
he again warned about getting involved with syria , and also cast suspicion upon refugees , whose flight out of the nation had prompted an international crisis .
â€ the most vocal in their outrage were leaders from the small but influential white nationalist movement .

â€œ the circus had to be all things to all people .

wild animals at ringling have long sparked protest .
in 1925 , the ringling brothers dropped the acts because â€œ the impression has been spread that wild animals are taught their tricks by cruel methods , â€ they told the new york times .
today â€™ s animal rights groups raise the same issues .
â€œ the circus can â€™ t find anybody who wants to buy a ticket to see their cruelty and displays of human dominance over animals , â€ said rachel mathews , associate director of captive animal law enforcement for people for the ethical treatment of animals , which did not take part in the lawsuits .

cats emphatically do not understand english and studiously disregard their owner â€™ s calls .
with their supersensitive hearing , some may dislike the volume of the human voice , especially in confined quarters .
if you flatter your cat , do so in a reverent whisper .
snuggle or hug your cat ?
actually , cats may abhor the smell of our favorite perfumes and soaps , and some are allergic to human dandruff .
feed your cat treats ?
our cats â€™ jiggling physiques insult their status .
real respect requires something much more than babying it requires overhauling our whole perspective on cat kind .
it â€™ s time to open our eyes â€” like really , really wide , the way my sister â€™ s cat does when it spies the vacuum cleaner â€” and see this animal for what it really is : not a helpless furball to be patronized and mollycoddled , but an entity both fearsome and sublime , commanding respect in the manner of a mafia don , or the ocean .
no creature is more exquisitely sensitive , and yet none is hardier .
none beguiles us more but needs us less .
there are more than 600 million domestic cats on the planet today , and we are to explain why .
in an era when lions , tigers and other types of felines flirt with extinction , house cats are themselves an intensifying menace to endangered species .
it hasn â€™ t been an easy takeover .
in fact , chaotic human homes , with their noises , stenches and overbearing occupants , may be the most radical and challenging environment that these little hunters , which flourish on deserted islands and the slopes of active volcanoes , have yet faced .
so on tuesday â€” and i know , it â€™ s hard â€” resist the urge to simply cuddle your cat with reckless abandon .
meanwhile , there are also a few simple tributes that your cat might actually appreciate .
for starters , as ohio state university â€™ s indoor pet initiative suggests , figure out your cat â€™ s personal â€œ prey preference â€ and buy anatomically appropriate toys .
create a household zone called a â€œ refuge , â€ which is a bit like a panic room with blankets .
and it never hurts to add an extra litter box , or three .

and no , i don â€™ t mean the subjects of this musical , the magnates elizabeth arden and helena rubinstein , though they were certainly no slouches in the art of the deal .
i â€™ m talking about the resourceful and resolute women portraying those resourceful and resolute women , christine ebersole and patti lupone .
if that sounds like heavy lifting , ms. ebersole and ms. lupone seldom betray the strain .
after all , the creators of â€œ war paint â€ â€” doug wright ( book ) scott frankel ( music ) and michael korie ( lyrics ) â€” have lovingly roles for ms. lupone and ms. ebersole in a show that assures them separate entrances , down a staircase ( for ms. ebersole ) and a gangplank ( for ms. lupone ) .
both in their 60s , these enduringly vital actresses have reached an age where the field of juicy starring parts in musicals often feels limited to those of momma rose in â€œ gypsy â€ ( ms. lupone has already won a tony for that ) and the title character of â€œ hello , dolly ! â€ ( this season by bette midler ) .
( ms. ebersole â€™ s arden describes her and rubinstein as â€œ dueling actresses in our umpteenth sequel .
â€ ) like â€œ feud , â€ â€œ war paint â€ depicts a bitter rivalry between glamorous women struggling to stay in control in a field that is notorious for seeing women as perishable commodities .
and neither show shies entirely from the camp factor that is catnip to gay men and their female soul mates .
there is no record of rubinstein and arden â€™ s having met , though they ruled their beauty empires from the same manhattan neighborhood in the same era .
( the show is set between 1935 and 1964 . )
this lack of time has forced the authors of â€œ war paint â€ to depict the women â€™ s twinned biographies as a series of parallel lives , acted out in counterpoint on separate sides of the stage .
for arden , that â€™ s her husband , tommy lewis ( john dossett ) for rubinstein , her gay man , harry fleming ( douglas sills ) .
it now begins not with its stars at separate vanity tables , contemplating their visages , but with a chorus of smartly dressed women heeding the call of a bodiless voice to beautify themselves .
( what other musical features songs listing ingredients in face creams ? )
ms. lupone , wearing heavy jewels and a polish accent to match , is as imposing as rubinstein must have been , and presumably a whole lot funnier .
ms. ebersole , blithe and brittle , is equally formidable in a lighter vein .
so , though my eyes occasionally glazed seeing â€œ war paint â€ for the second time , i wouldn â€™ t have missed it , if only to hear its leading ladies â€™ climactic ballads .
and in the show â€™ s most exquisite number , arden takes inventory of an existence lived in a pale shade of rose .
the song is called â€œ pink , â€ and as ms. ebersole delivers that seemingly cheery word , it is weighted with triumph , regret , defiance and anger , all struggling for ascendancy .
it â€™ s a reminder of how a single ballad , and a lone interpreter , can capture the full , ambivalent spectrum of a lifetime . ''
â€ generally , the sign is obeyed .
but during an untamed time , not long ago , new yorkers routinely slid open the doors at the ends of train cars and stood in the open space as the train hurtled through the tunnel .
as the city and the subway system deteriorated in subsequent decades , riding between cars became part of the chaotic subterranean landscape : trains were covered with graffiti and broke down often , passengers smoked cigarettes or worse , and doors between cars banged open and shut of their own accord , practically inviting trespass .
a law against traveling between the cars of a moving train was already on the books .
on an n train on thursday , ronald dupree , a bouncer and car salesman who grew up in brownsville , brooklyn , recalled his childhood pastime fondly .
the fine for switching cars is $ 75 .
in wilder times , passengers moved between cars for reasons other than fun .
not that you should do it .

â€ the chemical attack in the syrian town of khan sheikhoun on tuesday killed more than 80 people and afflicted hundreds more .
that risks dragging out a war that mr. putin has depicted at home as quick , cheap and easy at a time when many russians have been struggling economically .
the ostensible reason that mr. putin deployed his military in syria in september 2015 was to fight terrorism , but that is often dismissed as the logic .
russia faults the united states for destabilizing countries like iraq and libya â€” which some think has provided an opening for islamic extremists â€” a scenario mr. putin was determined to avoid in syria .
while that raised suspicions in the united states of collusion , it was welcomed in russia as a new dawn in relations .

â€œ that was a horrible , horrible thing , â€ he told reporters after the chemical attack .

because china also buys half of the world â€™ s new solar panels , it now effectively controls the market .

over the next six years , beijing pushed banks to provide at least $ 18 billion in loans at rates to manufacturers , and encouraged local governments to subsidize them with cheap land .
at the same time , china also became a major player in wind power through similar policies .
in 2012 and 2013 , the united states and the european union concluded that chinese makers were collecting government subsidies and dumping panels , or selling them for less than the cost of producing and shipping them .
both imposed import limits .

she also named herself foreign minister .
but critics suggest she suffers from stockholm syndrome , becoming too cozy with her former captors .
she takes that approach with government , and it is highly misplaced .
politics is compromise .

those who bet against her lost .
ms. fitzpatrick began her career at o â€™ connor associates , the chicago firm that was later acquired by ubs as the swiss bank â€™ s internal hedge fund .
in taking the job , she follows in the footsteps of finance legends including keith anderson , a of blackrock , and stanley druckenmiller , the billionaire investor .
in 1992 , he made a $ 1 billion bet against the british pound .
and soros is not just another family office designed to maximize wealth .
ms. fitzpatrick is bullish .
in the summer of 2008 , ms. fitzpatrick received a call from richard s. fuld , then the chief executive of lehman brothers .
mr. fuld acknowledged that lehman â€™ s stock was tumbling , but he told ms. fitzpatrick it would recover and asked her not to pull the billions of dollars that o â€™ connor had with the bank â€™ s prime brokerage , a division that lends stock and cash to clients for trading , in exchange for housing some of the funds â€™ capital .
ms. fitzpatrick had a quandary .
but if she kept her balance and lehman went bankrupt , she would lose billions of dollars for ubs o â€™ connor â€™ s clients .
if the stock goes to $ 15 , i â€™ m taking half out , and if the stock reaches $ 10 , i â€™ m taking it all out , â€™ â€ mr. meyer recalled .
though the episode left her shaken , it was the kind of quick thinking she had prepared for .
by her own description , ms. fitzpatrick was â€œ short and scrawny .
even as a girl , her investing prowess was evident .
after graduating from the university of pennsylvania â€™ s wharton school with a bachelor of science degree in 1992 , ms. fitzpatrick landed a job with o â€™ connor associates as part of a junior group of american stock exchange clerks .
there , groups of traders gathered in pits to buy and sell major trading contracts , yelling out their orders while gesticulating madly .
â€ in the course of her career , ms. fitzpatrick has tangled with regulators .
while chief investment officer of o â€™ connor , ms. fitzpatrick oversaw the firm â€™ s $ 5 .
3 million settlement with the securities and exchange commission over charges that from 2009 to 2011 it had bought stocks in companies â€™ public offerings while also taking the opposite position , those same stocks .
the bank denied wrongdoing .
more than 23 firms were slapped with similar charges .
â€œ but those tended to be offset by the times when i thought it was an advantage to be a woman .
yet ms. fitzpatrick has also caught herself masking her femininity to keep up with her male colleagues .
â€ such ambition can be a distraction , too .
she was often sick to her stomach , and was also getting heavier , but she figured her discomfort was a result of her stress .
plenty of her peers were having visceral reactions to the crisis .
it keeps her away from her three children and her husband more than she would like .
she admits , however , that her relentless drive is â€œ not necessarily a virtue for everyone .
others who have held ms. fitzpatrick â€™ s role have been caught up in the internal politics of the firm , and at times clashed with mr. soros himself .
last year , as britain prepared to vote on whether to exit the european union , mr. soros stepped back into his engagement , placing wagers that would be affected by the june referendum .

â€ it â€™ s true that the survey is an accurate indicator of where feist â€™ s head is lately â€” â€œ pleasure , â€ her first lp in six years , is concerned with similarly lofty themes and broad questions , with the music serving as her version of an answer .
it â€™ s relaxing .
â€ this is the state of a singer , now 41 , who has rejected a kind of fame that did not suit her in favor of a more personal version of her own making .
( â€œ pleasure â€ is also the album â€™ s first song and single . )
â€œ pleasure is implicit in pain , which is implicit in pleasure .
â€ amid the success of â€œ the reminder , â€ her 2007 album that featured â€œ 1234 , â€ feist took on a rather inaccurate reputation for tweeness through her most widespread songs ( see also : â€œ mushaboom , â€ â€œ i feel it all â€ ) .
but with â€œ metals â€ in 2011 , she shook off any lingering commercial expectations , recasting her ambitions with more complex songwriting draped in grand , intricate musical layers .
this time around , following that palate cleanser , she tore it all down .
â€œ just when you thought you had that maneuver clocked , now with this , it â€™ s like , â€˜ oh , you thought that was a hard left ? â€™ no , no , that wasn â€™ t a hard left at all .
this is a hard left .

â€œ leslie felt to be in a band with her friends â€” she decided what i â€™ m doing with the rest of my life ? â€ feist pondered .
â€œ i just took a minute to see if any other lightning would strike me â€” a different moment , a different era .
â€ she added : â€œ of course i worked really hard , but it â€™ s been completely built on a zeitgeist and luck and timing .
i didn â€™ t want to keep just plunking quarters in the meter as if i owe it something â€” or as if it owes me something .
it had to be a legitimate exchange .
and it turned out it was .
â€œ she was really owning every note , every decision .
â€ such artistic possessiveness may have stemmed from a perceived loss of control around the success of â€œ 1234 â€ â€” a song she did not even write â€” which snowballed from an ipod commercial to â€œ sesame street , â€ the pop charts and the grammys , where feist was nominated for best new artist in 2008 alongside taylor swift and amy winehouse .
â€œ my goal was to just very carefully descend the ladder with dignity , and go back to the altitude that i can breathe at .

â€ that statement stood in contrast not only to mr. tillerson â€™ s comments but also to ms. haley â€™ s own remarks a week ago â€” before mr. assad carried out his latest chemical weapons attack on civilians â€” in which she insisted that his departure from office was not a diplomatic priority for the united states .

here are some excerpts from the book , with explanations from the new york times .
and sometimes they arrive late .
mr. bannon has famously argued that the overreaching and ineffective federal government â€” â€œ the administrative state , â€ as he calls it â€” needs to be dismantled .
and if we don â€™ t do that , it â€™ s hard to ever renew anything .
they also see the possibility of retribution and punishment for those who resist or refuse to comply with the new expectations for conformity .
but they may not be able to .
mr. bannon has told confidants that he believes mr. kushner â€™ s contact with russians , and his expected testimony before congress on the subject , will become a major distraction for the white house .
but mr. bannon has his own core of supporters outside the white house .
mr. bannon â€™ s team is blamed for the contested and controversial travel bans .
mr. priebus was damaged by the failure of health care legislation .

2436,20005 , in the shadow of a fairy tale - the new york times , new york times , leslie jamison,2017-04-09,2017.0,4.0 , , '' when she was 6 , my stepdaughter , lily , told me that her favorite character in â€œ cinderella â€ was the evil stepmother .
this wasn â€™ t entirely surprising .
maybe it was thrilling to stage her own mistreatment , to take power over the situation of powerlessness she had imagined .
maybe she just liked a virtuous reason to dump water on the floor .
â€ for all her cruelty , the evil stepmother is often the character most defined by imagination and determination , rebelling against the patriarchy with whatever meager tools have been left to her : her magic mirror , her vanity , her pride .
she isn â€™ t simply acted upon she acts .
that â€™ s her fuel , and her festering heart .
her mother died just before her 3rd birthday , after a struggle with leukemia .
when i read her the old fairy tales about daughters without mothers , i worried that i was pushing on the bruises of her loss .
when i read her the old fairy tales about stepmothers , i worried i was reading her an evil version of myself .
i sought these tales avidly when i first became a stepmother .
our family lived in the aftermath of loss , not rupture â€” death , not divorce .
the stepmother from â€œ hansel and gretel â€ sends her stepchildren into the woods because there isn â€™ t enough to eat .
cinderella sits amid her fireplace cinders , sorting peas from lentils , her body appeasing a wicked stepmother who wants to dull her luminosity with soot because she feels threatened by it .
i uprooted my life for our love , without regret .
i hated the idea of bribing lily , trading plastic for affection , but i was desperately nervous .
i suddenly doubted myself : was it not a disney movie ?
there â€™ s a worldwide shortage .
â€ she was serious .
they had nothing .
not even a tiara .
or they had plenty of tiaras , but they weren â€™ t the right tiaras .
there had to be other movies lily liked , right ?
other princesses ?
there was a moment when i considered buying something related to every princess , just to cover my bases .
i had some vague realization that the panic in the back of my throat was the fuel capitalism ran on .
on my cellphone , i was on hold with a toys â€œ r â€ us in the bronx .
it had cardboard packaging : a sled .
i can not even tell you my relief .
my sense of victory was complete .
the sled came with a princess , and also maybe a prince .
i tucked the box under my arm protectively as i walked to the register .
i called charles , triumphant .
i told him the whole saga : the clerk â€™ s laughter , the worldwide shortage , the frantic phone calls , the sudden grace of glimpsing cardboard .
the possibility of failure hung like a low sky , pending weather , over every horizon .
enchanted woods and castles are so conspicuously fantastical , their situations so extreme , that children don â€™ t need to feel destabilized by their upheavals .
â€ i wondered if claiming the stepmother as her favorite was another version of playing orphans â€” a way of claiming the source of fear and taking some control over it .
did she love me fiercely so i wouldn â€™ t ?
i actually found a strange kind of comfort in the nightmare visions of mean stepparents i found in popular media â€” at least i wasn â€™ t cruel like them .
it was a kind of ethical schadenfreude .
in fairy tales , the was often duped and blind .
he had faith in a woman who didn â€™ t deserve it .
his trust , or his lust , permitted his daughter â€™ s mistreatment .
he knew how much it meant to learn the difference between the animated ponies with wings and the animated ponies with horns and the animated ponies with both â€” the alicorns .
he knew what it meant to do all that , and then wake up and do it all over again .
my relationship with lily , too , was not like the story we inherited from fairy tales â€” a tale of cruelty and rebellion â€” or even like the story of popular media : the child spurning her stepmother , rejecting her in favor of the true mother , the mother of bloodline and womb .
our story was a thousand conversations on the 6 train or at the playground in madison square park .
our story was telling her to take deep breaths during tantrums , because i needed to take deep breaths myself .
â€œ you lie here , â€ lily told me .
â€ if the wicked stepmother feels like a archetype , then its purest , darkest incarnation is the evil queen from â€œ snow white .
â€ in the brothers grimm tale from 1857 , she asks a hunter to bring back her stepdaughter â€™ s heart .
after this attack fails ( the hunter has a bleeding heart of his own ) the stepmother â€™ s aggression takes the form of false generosity .
she goes to her stepdaughter in disguise , as an old beggar crone , to offer snow white objects that seem helpful or nourishing : a corset , a comb , an apple .
she cooks and cleans and cares for them .
her virtue is manifest in precisely the maternal impulse her stepmother lacks .
the evil stepmother is so integral to our familiar telling of â€œ snow white â€ that i was surprised to discover that an earlier version of the story doesn â€™ t feature a stepmother at all .
in this version , snow white has no dead mother , only a living mother who wants her dead .
â€œ it is not only a means of preserving an internal mother when the real mother is not all good , â€ bettelheim argues , â€œ but it also permits anger at this bad â€˜ stepmother â€™ without endangering the good will of the true mother , who is viewed as a different person .
she wouldn â€™ t have bribed her with ridiculous amounts of plastic .
a woman mothering another woman â€™ s child , winnicott observes , â€œ may easily find herself forced by her own imagination into the position of witch rather than fairy godmother .
lindenauer argues that the popular imagination took the same terrible attributes that the puritans had ascribed to witches â€” malice , selfishness , coldness , absence of maternal impulse â€” and started ascribing them to stepmothers instead .
â€œ moreover , witches and stepmothers alike were most often accused of harming other women â€™ s children .
by the late 18th century , the stepmother was a stock villain , familiar enough to appear in grammar books .
but the american popular imagination hasn â€™ t always understood the stepmother as a wicked woman .
if it was true that she was an gold digger â€” a witch â€” then it was also true that she was a saint , happily prostrate to the surge of her own innate maternal impulse .
you didn â€™ t have to have a biological connection â€” or even an innate caregiving impulse â€” you just had to apply yourself .
she eventually started to detect a pattern .
the stepmother became a kind of â€œ port in the storm , â€ lindenauer told me .
her siblings worry about her marrying a widower with children , afraid she will become a kind of indentured servant , but the novel reassures us that â€œ her energetic spirit and love of children animated her to embrace joyfully the cares which such a choice must impose on her .
but she won â€™ t let him apologize .
they can call her mother , but they don â€™ t have to .
when i read in the novel â€™ s epigraph , â€œ fail â€” yet rejoice , â€ it felt like a lie and an impossible imperative at once .
or fifth !
or 10th !
â€” but she didn â€™ t care .
she just wanted to be useful .
i thought i would be glad to discover these virtuous stepmothers , but instead i found them nearly impossible to accept â€” much harder to stomach than the wicked stepmothers in fairy tales .
my poisoned apple wasn â€™ t the wicked stepmother but her archetypal opposite , the saint , whose innate virtue felt like the harshest possible mirror .
it would always show me someone more selfless than i was .
this is why fairy tales are more forgiving than sentimental novels : they let darkness into the frame .
this parent .
i also wanted to turn around .
i hadn â€™ t been pregnant , given birth , felt my body surge with the hormones of attachment .
i woke up every morning to a daughter who called me mommy but also missed her mother .
i often called our situation â€œ singular , â€ but as with so many kinds of singularity , it was a blade â€” a source of loneliness and pride at once â€” and its singularity was also , ultimately , a delusion .
â€œ lots of people are stepparents , â€ my mother told me once , and of course she was right .
i can guarantee you that almost all these women sometimes feel like frauds or failures .
â€ when i read that passage , it stopped me dead with longing .
i wanted to be in that meeting , sitting with those ordinary men and women â€” hearing about their bribes , their everyday impatience , their frustration and felt fraudulence , their desperate sleds .
in the methodology portion of her â€œ poisoned apple â€ study , church admits that she disclosed to her subjects that she was also a stepmother before interviewing them .
it was something like the imagined gathering of unsuccessful stepparents , as if they were at an alcoholics anonymous meeting in a church basement , taking earned solace in the minor triumphs and frequent failures of their kind : a kind of kin .
the decision to call the stepmother mother , or the decision not to call her mother , is often a dramatic hinge in stories about stepmothers , a climactic moment of acceptance or refusal .
â€ but lo !
the stepmother is undeterred .
for lily , calling me mother wasn â€™ t the end of anything .
but we weren â€™ t in the credits .
i was terrified .
she didn â€™ t want me to tell her dad .
it was like the universe had sent its first maternal test .
was she drunk ?
what should i do ?
if i was going to let myself be called mommy , i had to be prepared to deal with the fallout from the birthday party .
charles eventually deduced that she had had a few sips of iced tea .
it was as if lily had bestowed a deep and immediate trust in me â€” unearned , born of need â€” and now i had to figure out how to live inside that trust without betraying it .
everyone had ideas about our family without knowing anything about our family .
â€œ what are you hoping for from this trip ?
a tighter family bond ?
a chance to let go of the sadness ?
or .
..
? ?
tug at our heartstrings a bit .
more than anything , i liked her â€œ or .
.. ?
? â€ it rang true .
which felt even more alarming , somehow , to be so knowable to strangers .
but every theory also felt incomplete .
and also like this , and like this , and like this .
by the time he returns from his mission victorious , the royal court is ready to burn himinbjorg at the stake , because everyone is convinced that she is responsible for his disappearance .
perhaps i wanted credit for mothering more than i wanted to mother .
then there was hildur .
â€œ all stepmothers are evil , â€ he tells his brother , â€œ and i don â€™ t wish to harm ingibjorg .
he knows the deal with stepmoms .
but he falls in love with hildur anyway .
but those afternoons mattered , because they belonged to me and lily .
ours .
a few months later , reading dr. seuss â€™ s â€œ horton hatches the egg â€ to lily in that new apartment , i felt my throat constricting .
horton agrees to sit on an egg while mayzie the bird , a flighty mother , takes a vacation to palm beach .
love is effort and desire â€” not a sentimental story line about easy or immediate attachment , but the complicated bliss of joined lives : sandwiches , growing pains at midnight , car seats covered in vomit .
that mother is not a saint .
she â€™ s not a witch .
she â€™ s just an ordinary woman .
that was how it began . ''

question 21 on the department â€™ s list addresses some of these issues .
the right kind of employer this is what the lawsuit is about .

jessica schreiber , 28 , the founder and sole paid employee of a nonprofit , has her own concerns .
before starting graduate school , she plotted her loans , payments and career choices according to the rules of the loan forgiveness program .
let â€™ s call the education department â€™ s refusal to clarify the matter exactly what it is : meanness .
as the site explains , if the word â€œ direct â€ isn â€™ t in the title of your loan , it probably doesn â€™ t qualify .
when dr. darius amjadi , a pathologist and iraq war veteran in portland , ore. began his work with a veterans â€™ hospital , he thought he had a shot at loan forgiveness from the veterans affairs department â€™ s own program .
at the same time , his employer informed him that his loans would be eligible for public service loan forgiveness .
if you think that sounds like you , call your servicer and ask , then ask again at a different time to be sure .
my inquiries to the education department about this matter yielded no replies .
but the program is confusing , the government â€™ s legal filings contradict its websites , and its representatives aren â€™ t answering questions .
it â€™ s a shameful message at any time , but it â€™ s particularly galling when it â€™ s firefighters , librarians and nurses on the receiving end . ''
his appointment is a swap , a conservative replacing another conservative .
the answer shows just how polarized the supreme court has become .
a majority of its members would have been democratic appointees for the first time in almost 50 years .
but it has not always been thus .
judge gorsuch is 49 .
were mr. trump to replace any of the three , a court that generally leans right would have a conservative majority .
a range of other liberal policy priorities could also have been preserved , even though judge garland is not especially liberal .
the ability of agencies to safeguard clean air and water , civil rights and workplace safety would be less threatened .
â€œ they will have a conservative bent .
they will be protecting the second amendment .

to revisit the very first police consent decree is to examine a microcosm of the agreements â€™ potential , and their limitations .
a tiny provision , known as section 14141 , was inserted into a crime bill signed into law by mr. clinton in 1994 .
in 1995 , pittsburgh had its own rodney king â€” jonny gammage , a black businessman and cousin of a lineman for the pittsburgh steelers , who died of asphyxiation during a struggle with white police officers in the suburbs .
a. c. p. at the time .
also on his list : computers , which the justice department ultimately required the city to buy .
the justice department had a list of demands â€” for instance , that every passenger â€™ s race and sex be recorded during traffic stops .
chief mcneilly protested , questioning the practicality and legality of such a requirement .
in the end , only the driver â€™ s information was tracked .
â€œ all cities are on their own , and then it â€™ s dependent on the local community and local politics .
suddenly , pittsburgh was thrown back into its past .

but mr. stevens is worried that what he is hearing from washington will cause the ripples to subside .
so are officials in chicago and baltimore , who , in a sign of how some cities have come to embrace federal intervention , have objected to a retreat from police overhauls .
the baltimore police commissioner , kevin davis , called the justice department â€™ s effort to delay the agreement â€œ a punch in the gut .

â€œ as soon as we heard he would be playing here , we bought tickets , â€ he said .

â€ and after thursday â€™ s home run , and a victory by the fireflies , tebow gave a rousing speech to a roomful of coaches and teammates .
he grew up in ocala , fla. a short drive from gainesville .
when winningham was a boy , tebow was his favorite football player .
a little older , maybe , but totally down to earth .
but now , benjamin sees tebow as a real attraction for his city , and maybe for the sport tebow is trying to master .
at least that was the prevailing feeling after thursday â€™ s game .

2444,20013 , '' along the mekong river , a timeless place where time marches on - the new york times '' , new york times , edward wong,2017-04-23,2017.0,4.0 , , '' deep in the folds of the hill , up steep stone stairs flanked with frangipani trees , stood the inner sanctum of the ancient khmer temple of vat phou .
we faced the mountain ridge , our backs to the waters of the mekong river , looking for the chamber .
from this angle , it was hidden .
lesser known and distinct from angkor in its intimacy is vat phou , sometimes written in english as wat phu , which has been designated a world heritage site by a united nations agency .
this was the middle leg of a whirlwind trip through southeast asia that we regarded as our farewell to the region .
and while in china , as a couple and then a family , we had spent much of our vacation time exploring the region .
we told the family we were fleeing the notorious beijing pollution .
we had a balcony room overlooking the river .
in the mountains looming to our west , hidden by jungle , lay vat phou .
the builders of vat phou had noticed this and proclaimed it a natural lingam of shiva .
a hotel employee , taiy , told me of the importance of rituals at the temple .
a bell rang somewhere .
they had bought incense sticks from a woman outside the temple .
they prayed with the lit sticks .
sweet smoke drifted through the temple .
it was her offering .
another depicted deities taking part in the churning of the ocean of milk , an image that i had also seen a decade earlier at angkor .
outside , more worshipers were arriving .
we walked along the slope of the mountain behind the temple .
on the site were the ruins of a small library , a sacred spring and a cave shrine .
at a cistern , laotians anointed themselves with water that flowed from mountain springs .
it was the wider natural surroundings that cast a spell on us .
the temple commanded the scene , as its cousins at angkor did in the cambodian jungles .
we had brought bicycles with us , and i strapped aria to my back with a baby sling .
a herd of water buffalo wandered languidly down the sandy beach to drink at the river .
we biked along dirt paths to villages .
outside their homes , women fried up rice cakes in pans .
at lunchtime , we stopped at la folie , a lodge .
it overlooked the river and faced the spine of mountains to the west .
had i been there ?
i shook my head .
timeless asia , indeed .
that evening , we took a sunset boat ride on the mekong with a dutch couple .
over canapÃ©s and bottles of beerlao , we spoke with kanh , a hotel worker accompanying us .
he had begun working at river resort three months earlier .
while his mother had been born here , her parents were from hue , the old imperial capital in central vietnam .
they had fled the fall of south vietnam to communist forces in 1975 , only to eventually settle in another communist country .
her ancestors , too , were from hue , and she and her family had also fled vietnam in 1975 .
this stretch of the mekong was filled with small islets and rocks .
waterfalls abounded .
we stayed for a couple of nights on the northern side of don khon .
they sat there with umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun and pointed whenever the head or back of a dolphin poked above the water for a few seconds .
2445,20014 , frederick wiseman : the filmmaker who shows us ourselves - the new york times , new york times , a.o .
his movies are about specific places â€” institutions , organizations , cities and communities : the new york neighborhood of jackson heights the coastal town of belfast , me .
his documentaries can be long .
the and running times might seem forbidding , but there is rarely a dull moment , in spite of the absence of conventional narrative .
constantly working also keeps me off the street , or at least on the streets that i like .
â€ the legal wrangling centered on the inmates â€™ rights versus the public â€™ s right to know and opened a constellation of issues involving documentary ethics and thorny questions of informed consent .
by then , the soldiers are marching in sync â€” chanting â€œ mr .
â€ mr. wiseman , who began his career as a filmmaker in that decade , has a preoccupation with process that may be a generational characteristic .
or it may just be that he â€™ s a sensitive chronicler of modern life , an enormous proportion of which consists of committee work .
a meeting â€” formal or informal , routine or hastily gathered , tedious or contentious â€” amounts to a wiseman signature , like a shootout in a tarantino movie or a dirty joke in a judd apatow comedy .
but you also gain a kind of ecstatic anthropological insight into rituals that are both banal and outlandish , and an initiation into the mysteries of human psychology .
meetings are the most quotidian moments in a wiseman documentary , but also , often , the most intriguing .
they are nuggets of real life and eruptions of pure theater .
that â€™ s particularly true in the earlier films , in which the images are sometimes matched by a startling manicheanism .
it â€™ s a moment of gentleness amid more difficult , at times violent encounters between cops and civilians , as in a horrifying scene in which a white plainclothes detective puts a chokehold on a black prostitute , an action so harsh her tongue juts out of her mouth .
as he shoots out questions â€” â€œ what are you doin â€™ here ?
, â€ â€œ where you goin â€™ ?
, â€ â€œ pass ? â€ â€” this disciplinarian isn â€™ t just corralling kids , he is , of course , also preparing them for lives of 9 to 5 submission .
woe to the resisters !
mr. wiseman avoids these techniques entirely .
we eavesdrop not only to figure out what â€™ s happening , but also to attend to idioms and rhythms , to the musical qualities of speech .
but words aren â€™ t all we hear .
jackson heights in an accident of demography , geography and zoning .
who are they ?
( â€œ it â€ being that elusive thing we like to call democracy . )
we observe gatherings of senior citizens , gay and lesbian residents and recent immigrants .
how do we balance rights and obligations ?
how do we pursue prosperity without trampling our cherished traditions and common spaces ?
some of the most moving scenes take place in mr. dromm â€™ s office , where members of his staff answer phone calls from constituents who need to talk to someone in government .
they don â€™ t always have the right branch â€” their concerns include constitutional law and united states military policy â€” but the courtesy and patience with which they are treated provide a timely and permanent lesson in democratic values .

2 million â€” the scope of the fraud was huge : 5 , 300 bankers were fired for creating as many as two million unwanted bank and credit card accounts .
the warning signs were glaring and could be traced back at least to 2004 , the investigators said .
neither ms. tolstedt , who was allowed to retire in july but was subsequently fired , nor mr. stumpf , who was permitted to retire in october after being castigated during congressional hearings on the scandal , was available on monday to comment .
mr. stumpf cooperated with the board â€™ s investigation ms. tolstedt declined to be interviewed .
all told , mr. stumpf will surrender $ 69 million , and ms. tolstedt will lose $ 67 million , including stock options that they forfeited last year .
in 2007 , william w. mcguire of unitedhealthgroup was forced to give back $ 618 million over backdating options .
structurally , the bank was too decentralized , with department heads like ms. tolstedt given the mantra of â€œ run it like you own it â€ and granted broad authority to shake off questions from superiors , subordinates or lateral colleagues .
particularly in arizona and los angeles , where the toxic culture was most pronounced , some managers explicitly told subordinates to sell people accounts even if they did not need them .
because of the bank â€™ s decentralized structure , the problem went unnoticed for a long time .
when it finally came to light â€” thanks in part to an investigation by the los angeles times â€” the bank was slow to take action .
â€ mr. stumpf , who retired in october , exercised all of his remaining options and converted them to stock â€” which he retained â€” in the months before wells fargo announced its $ 185 million settlement with the consumer financial protection bureau , the office of the comptroller of the currency and the los angeles city attorney in september .
he held 2 .
5 million shares as of late february , currently valued at $ 137 million .
the $ 28 million that the board is taking back from mr. stumpf â€” the proceeds of a 2013 equity grant â€” will be deducted from his retirement plan payouts , mr. sanger said .
such conclusions are unlikely to quiet the bank â€™ s critics .

2454,20023 , united airlines passenger is dragged from an overbooked flight - the new york times , new york times , daniel victor and matt stevens,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0 , , '' the disturbing scene captured on cellphone videos by united airlines passengers on sunday went beyond the typical nightmares of travelers on an overbooked flight .
an unidentified man who refused to be bumped from a plane screamed as a security officer wrestled him out of his seat and dragged him down the aisle by his arms .
â€ the shocking scene raised questions about the common practice of overbooking and how far airlines will go to sell all of their seats .
the videos show a security officer removing the unidentified man from his seat and dragging him off the plane as he screams .
airlines routinely sell tickets to more people than the plane can seat , counting on several people not to arrive .
â€œ to an airline , an empty seat is basically the same thing as stale bread .
it â€™ s something they can never sell again .
â€ but involuntarily bumping passengers is rare .
in 2016 , united involuntarily denied boarding to 3 , 765 of its more than 86 million passengers on oversold flights , according to the transportation department .
an additional 62 , 895 people voluntarily gave up their seats .
critics called the policy sexist and overbearing .
mr. hobart , the united spokesman , confirmed that united sought passengers willing to give up their seats with compensation but that none stepped forward .
i â€™ m a doctor i have to see patients in the morning .
â€ the united employee then told the man that if he did not get off the plane , she would call security .
the situation also became uncomfortable for the united employees who then got on board and took the vacated seats , mr. bridges said .
â€ jayse anspach , a seminary student who was also on the flight , said that when the man returned to the plane , he ran toward the back .

he has called modeling his â€œ baptism into fashion .
he also obtained a degree from goldsmiths , university of london .
mr. enninful was a driving force behind the â€œ grunge â€ movement of the 1990s , and he became a contributing editor to italian vogue in 1998 .
he spearheaded the magazine â€™ s â€œ black issue , â€ declaring his intention to end the â€œ that dominates the catwalks and magazines .
he is generally known to be gracious and friendly , characteristics that are not traditionally associated with the fashion industry â€™ s uppermost echelons .

ellen pao , a former partner at kleiner perkins caufield byers , described an atmosphere of sexism and harassment at the venture capital firm â€” with little recourse .
but much of the training has been shown to be ineffective , and at worst can backfire .
â€œ it has a lot to do with the type of h. r. department : the motive is not the legal liability , but the culture you want .

five months later , â€œ the late show â€ has done what a year ago seemed unthinkable : it has become the most viewed show in late night .
it is more than possible that mr. colbert and mr. fallon , over time , could settle into a battle that will go back and forth .
but at this time last year , mr. colbert was losing by more than a million viewers to mr. fallon and feeling pressure from within cbs , which had named him the successor to david letterman with much fanfare .
the company â€™ s chief executive , leslie moonves , had serious concerns about the show , and the network â€™ s 12:35 a. m. host , james corden , was outshining him .
and now ?
the goal : to earn the chance to be â€” as mr. licht put it â€” â€œ resampled â€ by viewers .
for its first six months , â€œ the late show , â€ which debuted in september 2015 , was adrift .

2467,20037 , fewer tomatoes in ketchup ?
the countries of eastern and central europe have long bridled at being treated like the poor cousins of the european union family .
but now that sense of resentment â€” of being treated as citizens by more prosperous neighbors â€” is reaching even into the region â€™ s refrigerators and cupboards .
with rising passion , prominent politicians and local news media have taken up the issue of whether eastern europeans are being sold inferior products .
and they like the food issue , because it can be blamed on foreigners .
but bitter eastern europeans insist that their situation is different .
he denies that it has anything to do with politics .
in slovakia , the populist prime minister , robert fico , faces rising competition from extreme groups and a series of corruption scandals .
he has seized on the food issue , too .
â€ while rumors that inferior food is shipped to the east have swirled for years , only in 2011 did the slovak association of consumers conduct a comparison of a basket of products purchased in austria with the same products bought in slovakia .
she conducted a test with her own basket of products and found half were inferior .
and a subsequent survey of slovak and austrian foods had even worse results .
the czechs found that many products â€” mÃ¶venpick bourbon vanilla ice cream , carbonell extra virgin olive oil , heinz ketchup â€” were identical whether purchased in germany or in the czech republic .
rama classic margarine had lower fat content .
canned luncheon meat sold under the tulip brand was all pork in germany , but it included â€œ mechanically separated poultry meat â€ in the czech republic .
officials at rama did not respond to requests for comment .
â€ thus far , the only studies conducted have been between germany and the czech republic , and slovakia and austria , and these have involved only a small sampling .
but officials from the region now want all europe union countries to undergo testing , to determine how widespread the issue is .
food producers and industry experts insist there are often sound reasons for products to differ between countries : local tastes , a preference for local ingredients , divergent buying patterns .
â€œ locally we add the water , co2 , and some from the proven and authorized sweeteners .
â€œ foods are different , but also household products , like laundry detergent .
the soaps sold here are not as concentrated .

we may never know for sure whether he took an ounce of unmitigated pleasure in any of it .
suggestive as it is of rage , not just a chronic case of the eeyore blues , the striking word â€œ seething â€ is a useful window into letterman â€™ s uniqueness .
for that matter , neither does colbert , who stays psychologically tranquil even at his most morally indignant .
his brand of ridicule was too reflexive to be concerned with whether or not its targets were deserving .
the reason that callous streak seldom mattered was that he also never stopped insisting on his own ( and tv â€™ s ) triviality .
it was as if he felt irresistibly goaded to turn samuel beckett â€™ s â€œ krapp â€™ s last tape â€ into thousands of hours of videotape .
of all the unlikely outcomes , he was suddenly the most authentic personality on television .
his commentary is so compressed and fluid that you often scarcely notice how casually he â€™ s able to switch from micro to macro and back inside a single paragraph .
â€ the latter impulse stayed constant even when the primary world letterman inhabited on â€œ late show â€ was his own curmudgeonly , dissatisfied brain .
but it also predated his fame .
as early as middle school , he was equating with media constructs , enlisting a classmate to stage sham talk shows on a mock set in the friend â€™ s basement .

â€ ( â€œ without her , you and i wouldn â€™ t be sitting here , â€ letterman told an interviewer after their breakup . )
the same is true of letterman â€™ s longtime musical sidekick , paul shaffer , whose parody version of vegas smarm defined â€œ late night â€ as pure showbiz and pure simultaneously .
yet letterman â€™ s true originality may be that only a midwestern boomer who was every bit as easily unnerved as he was nervy could have combined the two .

united , on tuesday , appeared to backtrack from prior statements that the flight with dr. dao aboard â€” heading from o â€™ hare in chicago to louisville , ky. â€” was overbooked .
still , it is not uncommon for airlines to overbook , or sell more tickets than they have seats .
the odds of actually being booted from a flight involuntarily are quite low .

about 434 , 000 people voluntarily gave their seats up for compensation .

some airlines choose to bump the passengers who paid the lowest fares , while some choose the last passengers to check in .

by wednesday morning , the hashtag â€œ united forcibly removes passenger from plane â€ was the most popular topic on weibo , china â€™ s equivalent of twitter , garnering more than 550 million views and more than 240 , 000 comments .

while china â€™ s surplus with the united states is pretty big â€” almost $ 350 billion â€” its global surplus is modest , at 2 .
from 2000 to 2014 china definitely suppressed the rise of the renminbi to maintain a competitive advantage for its exports , buying dollars hand over fist and adding $ 4 trillion to its foreign reserves over the period .
until 2005 , the chinese government kept the renminbi pegged to the dollar , following it down as the greenback slid against other major currencies starting in 2003 .
and its surplus with the united states amounted to a full third of the american deficit with the world .
though the requirement that the treasury identify currency manipulators â€œ gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade â€ dates back to the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 , china was never called out .
or at least they seemed so at the time .
and the united states had bigger fish to fry .
and the united states had a stake in china â€™ s rise .
and when the financial crisis hit , it took the foot off the export pedal and deployed a giant fiscal stimulus , which bolstered internal demand .
if mediocre job prospects and low wages didn â€™ t stop american families from consuming , it was because the american financial system was flush with chinese cash and willing to lend , financing their homes and refinancing them to buy the furniture .
and yet a charge of manipulation would add irony upon irony .

it told a respectable tale .
but trump won â€” and some conservative intellectuals embraced a man who exploited the same brutish energies that buckley had supposedly banished .
historians , of course , are not called upon to be seers .
that is , ultimately , what we are called upon to explain .
he didn â€™ t take the conservatives of his own time at all seriously .
he called them â€œ pseudoconservatives â€ and described , for instance , followers of the republican senator joseph mccarthy as cranks who salved their â€œ status anxiety â€ with conspiracy theories and bizarre panaceas .
it betokened too a certain willful blindness toward the evidence that was already emerging of a popular backlash against liberalism .
historians seeking to grasp conservatism â€™ s newly revealed mass appeal would have to take the movement on its own terms .
but if hofstadter was overly dismissive of how conservatives understood themselves , the new breed of historians at times proved too credulous .
( as did william f .
buckley . )
foremost among them is leo ribuffo , a professor at george washington university .
â€ looking back from that perspective , we can now see a history that is indeed unsettling â€” but also unsettlingly familiar .
his subject was the decline of â€œ americanism .
â€ evans , a former dentist , proposed that his was â€œ a movement of plain people , â€ and acknowledged that this â€œ lays us open to the charge of being hicks and â€˜ rubes â€™ and â€˜ drivers of secondhand fords .
the klan also put the predations of the international banking class at the center of its rhetoric .
its worldview resembles , in fact , the politics of contemporary europe â€” a tradition , heretofore judged foreign to american politics , called â€œ herrenvolk republicanism , â€ that reserved social democracy solely for the white majority .
indeed , in the 1990s , a rich scholarly literature emerged on the 1920s klan and its extraordinary , and decidedly national , influence .
in 1937 , humphrey bogart starred in a film about it .
the story begins with father charles coughlin , the â€œ radio priest â€ who at his peak reached as many as 30 million weekly listeners .
â€ and , unlike in europe , fascists did not achieve governmental power .
nevertheless , continues , â€œ fascism had a very real presence in the u. s. a. comparable to that on continental europe .

â€™ s list .
but if screeners do notice marijuana in someone â€™ s or checked luggage , mr. anderson said , they will call in local airport law enforcement officials to deal with it .
of the 54 million passengers who went through denver international airport in 2015 , the t. s. a. stopped just 29 for possession of marijuana , an airport spokesman , heath montgomery , said .
all 29 complied , and no tickets were issued .
in 2016 , the airport did not keep a record of those stopped with the substance .
sales of medical and recreational marijuana are legal in colorado , and over $ 1 billion of marijuana was sold through dispensaries last year , said matthew a. karnes , founder of greenwave advisors , which analyzes the industry .
the comparatively small number of t. s. a. stops at the airport may mean that travelers have gotten the message that it is illegal to fly with marijuana and they leave it behind .
8 million passengers who were screened by t. s. a. at jacksonville international airport in 2016 were detained for possession of marijuana , said michael d. stewart , the airport â€™ s director of external affairs .
dogs assisting customs and border protection agents , however , are searching for illicit drugs along with other illegal substances , but only among passengers arriving in the united states on international flights .
â€ medical and recreational marijuana are legal in washington state .

the scope of the united states â€™ involvement has been extensive and highly visible .
in nigeria , american action appears more modest .
but the difference is also caused by the contrasting nature of the crises .
nigeria â€™ s problems are driven more by crises in governing .

now scientists at stanford university may have uncovered for the first time why taking deep breaths can be so calming .
the research , on a tiny group of neurons deep within the brains of mice , also underscores just how intricate and pervasive the links are within our body between breathing , thinking , behaving and feeling .
they dubbed these neurons the breathing pacemaker .
when they injected the animals with a virus that killed only those cells , the mice stopped sighing , the researchers discovered .
mice , like people , normally sigh every few minutes , even if we and they are unaware of doing so .
without instructions from these cells , the sighing stopped .
so for the newest study , which was published recently in science , the researchers carefully disabled yet another type of neuron in mice .
they sighed , yawned and otherwise breathed just as before .
it turned out that the particular neurons in question showed direct biological links to a portion of the brain that is known to be involved in arousal .
it also so far involves mice rather than people , although we are known to have breathing pacemakers that closely resemble those in rodents .

part of the problem is how we buy tickets today .
when you search online , you look for price and travel times , and perhaps you consider some airline loyalty program .
â€ you can see this in united â€™ s initial response to what happened on flight 3411 .
after all , the passenger was offered a bountiful $ 1 , 000 in united vouchers for his trouble .
as a united spokesman told the times , the passenger was â€œ asked several times , politely , â€ for his seat before anyone beat him up .
some people have ideas for how that may happen .
last year tripadvisor , the travel reviews site that has become indispensable for hotel bookings , began rating airlines .
but delta was the only major american airline to receive tripadvisor â€™ s seal of approval .
if instead of just price , travel search engines included prominent warnings from reviewers â€” â€œ this airline might give you a bloody lip while kicking you from your seat , ! â€ â€” that could alter travelers â€™ calculations in booking .
that is small potatoes , though .
some have tried a monthly subscription model , and none have taken off .

that contravened ms. alicea â€™ s verbal instructions as her designated health care agent and ms. stephenson â€™ s advance directive declining such procedures .

a decision in the case last july by the supreme court of georgia , however , may already have consequences for other plaintiffs .
dick magney had appointed his wife , judith , as his .
judith magney , 71 , and her lawyer spent months fighting the county , which tried to replace ms. magney as her husband â€™ s agent , started antibiotics he had earlier declined and briefly appointed a conservator .
in an interview , jeffrey blanck , counsel to the county , defended those actions on mr. magney â€™ s behalf because â€œ he was coming in and out of competency â€ and sometimes agreed to antibiotics .
mr. magney died in a nursing home in october 2015 at age 74 .
44 million , including punitive damages .
court clashes over advance directives hardly represent settled law .
state agencies also penalize nursing homes for resuscitating residents who have do not resuscitate , or d. n. r. orders .
they â€™ ve mostly levied paltry fines â€” $ 1 , 370 in connecticut , $ 16 , 000 in florida â€” but such actions can affect consumers â€™ choices of nursing homes .

they did not have osteoporosis their bones were not cracking from a lack of the vitamin .
they did not have diseases that interfere with vitamin d absorption .
perhaps they shouldn â€™ t have been .
but so firm is this belief that vitamin d has become popular even among people with no particular medical complaints or disease risks .
among patients with commercial insurance , testing rates rose 2. from 2009 to 2014 .
â€ as a consequence , millions of healthy people think they have a deficiency , and some are taking supplemental doses so high they can be dangerous , causing poor appetite , nausea and vomiting .
people do not make their own : we need sunlight to synthesize vitamin d. the vitamin also is found in oily fish and in a few other foods , including milk , which is fortified with the vitamin .
doctors , he believes , must take action .
diet can not provide that much of the vitamin , he notes .
and it would require nearly constant exposure to sunlight to reach the levels he recommends .
another study , published at the end of march , included 2 , 303 healthy postmenopausal women randomly assigned to take vitamin d and calcium supplements or a placebo .
the frenzy for vitamin d began not in natural food stores but in medical journals .
blood testing for the vitamin took off .
he also published books promoting the idea that vitamin d levels in that range were insufficient to promote good health .
vitamin d tests â€œ became incorporated into the general evaluation of patients , â€ he added .
ravinder j. singh , who runs a testing lab at the mayo clinic , was taken aback by the sudden deluge .

as gender boundaries blur and the old distinctions between men â€™ s wear and woman â€™ s wear ( not to mention men â€™ s and women â€™ s pronouns ) disappear , perhaps , too , should the old assumptions about men â€™ s and women â€™ s magazines .
increasingly , fashion brands , including burberry , calvin klein and gucci , are beginning to combine their men â€™ s and women â€™ s shows in recognition of this new reality .
men and women increasingly occupy the same space in real life fashion is simply representing that truth .
and now , too , are fashion publications .
â€œ maybe it â€™ s an old notion that there are magazines for women and magazines for men , and it is time to just have magazines for people interested in fashion and creativity , whatever their gender .
â€ as ceiling smashing as mr. enninful â€™ s gender is , however , so is his race .
nearly all of the design heads of major brands are white , as are the chief executives , so the fact that a black man will be in such a visible position is an important step â€” especially as britain prepares to withdraw from the european union and prejudice and cultural isolationism become more prevalent .

so why is it so hard for us to spend money on them ?
the reason for me is often that experiences tend to feel like an extravagant expenditure of money , time and energy .
sounds amazing , right ?
it would be $ 250 for the kayak rental , then a few hundred for food .
and the little inn where we wanted to stay was expensive .
was it responsible ?
did we have the money ?

2530,20109 , birth control causes depression ?
along with that have been lows in rates for teenage pregnancy and abortion .
researchers tracked all women and adolescent females ( ages 15 to 34 ) living in denmark from 2000 through 2014 .
the risks also peaked six months after the start of contraception .
but we have to acknowledge the limitations of this type of research .
it â€™ s not a controlled trial , and it â€™ s impossible to establish causality .
it â€™ s also possible that an antidepressant prescription isn â€™ t the best measure of depression .
we also have to place this study in context with others .
months earlier , a systematic review of all studies that looked at the relationship between hormonal contraception and depression was published in the european journal of contraception and reproductive health care .
finally , women who have underlying mood disorders were more predisposed to have side effects , but that could be related to their choosing different types of birth control rather than the birth control itself .
that study has to be weighed along with the rest .
in this case , the finding that common birth control causes depression is both .
even then , we need to rely on absolute risks , not relative risks .
7 were later prescribed an antidepressant .
2 were later prescribed an antidepressant .
we can also assume , though , that pretty much all of them would receive the benefit of birth control in family planning .
moreover , lest anyone forget , depression is also significantly associated with pregnancy , especially when that pregnancy is unintended .
depression is a listed side effect of birth control it â€™ s on the package inserts .
the drug i take for my ulcerative colitis has a real , if small , risk of causing myelosuppression .
we shouldn â€™ t ignore the potential for hormonal birth control to cause mood changes in women .
we also shouldn â€™ t pay attention only to those side effects , forgetting to place them in context with the benefits . ''

it is a thuggish image that mr. duterte embraces .
his mother whipped him so often for his misbehavior that she wore out her horsewhip , according to his brother , emmanuel duterte .
â€œ that is why he is always angry .
because if you have pain when you are young , you are angry all the time .
that act of devotion only begins to unravel the paradox that is mr. duterte .
behind his brutish caricature , according to interviews with dozens of mr. duterte â€™ s friends , family members , allies and critics , is a man who can be charming and engaging .
some put the toll at more than 7 , 000 .

the jesuit order agreed in 2007 to pay $ 16 million to nine people father falvey molested as children at a hollywood church .
for that , he was expelled .
a daredevil , he took flying lessons at 16 .
mr. duterte graduated anyway and became a prosecutor .
â€œ the more you tell him not to do it , the more he will do it .
he needs to tone down on his anger .
when he took office , much of davao was a war zone .
mr. dureza noticed that his pistol was cocked .
shortly after he became mayor , crime suspects started turning up dead on davao â€™ s streets .
mr. duterte and his supporters have long denied the existence of a death squad in davao city .
they were told their job was to hunt down criminals .
a police officer passed around a covered basket , and each recruit took out a weapon .

when they checked mr. amisola â€™ s body , the squad discovered that he worked for the national bureau of investigation .
she was arrested and jailed last month .
mr. duterte â€™ s personal death toll is harder to substantiate .
if he stabbed someone on the beach , there is no record of it .
but he recently acknowledged , â€œ i may have hit them all or none at all .
for months , he still thought of himself as mayor and often called himself that .
in a land that is notoriously corrupt and where government officials often live like kings , he has lived for decades in the same modest house where he only recently installed .
pomilda daniel , a neighbor , calls him â€œ a simple man .
he â€™ s not perfect .
he curses .
in 1973 , he eloped with elizabeth zimmerman , a former flight attendant , after courting her for a month .
the marriage lasted until 2000 , when it was annulled .
ms. duterte and ms. avanceÃ±a declined to be interviewed .
in december , he denied being addicted .
mr. duterte â€™ s energy and hair belie his age , but his afflictions have taken their toll .
during public appearances , he often presses his fingers against a nerve on the side of his face to reduce the pain .
he has not explained why .
he dislikes being questioned about his health .
he has compared himself to hitler .
â€œ do not destroy my country , because i will kill you .
on numerous occasions , his aides have had to walk back his comments .
â€ that mr. duterte â€™ s violent boasts should not always be taken literally matters little to his zealous supporters and is of little consolation to the families of the thousands killed by his policies .

the total value of yahoo shares is now about $ 35 billion .
the company may also disclose sales of patents and real estate , which it began shopping a couple of months ago in the hope of raising $ 1 billion to $ 3 billion .

2535,20115 , dilma rousseff targeted in brazil by lawmakers facing scandals of their own - the new york times , new york times , simon romero and vinod sreeharsha,2016-04-18,2016.0,4.0 , , '' brasÃ­lia â€” paulo maluf , a brazilian congressman , is so badly besieged by his own graft scandals that his constituents often describe him with the slogan â€œ rouba mas faz .
6 million in a kickback scheme .
the drive to impeach ms. rousseff is gaining momentum .
â€œ she didn â€™ t steal , but a gang of thieves is judging her .
â€ ms. rousseff is deeply resented in brazil , having presided over the worst economic crisis in decades , a huge corruption scandal engulfing the national oil company and the fall of millions of brazilians into poverty .
in the impeachment case , she is not facing charges of graft .
ms. rousseff , then , is something of a rarity among brazil â€™ s major political figures : she has not been accused of stealing for herself .
mr. cunha , an evangelical christian radio commentator and economist who regularly issues twitter messages quoting from the bible , is accused of laundering the gains through an evangelical megachurch .
renan calheiros , the senate leader , who is also on the presidential succession chain , is under investigation over claims that he received bribes in the giant scandal surrounding the national oil company , petrobras .
altogether , 60 percent of the 594 members of brazil â€™ s congress face serious charges like bribery , electoral fraud , illegal deforestation , kidnapping and homicide , according to transparency brazil , a group .
even so , some brazilians argue that the impeachment upheaval has less to do with stamping out corruption than with an effort to shift power by lawmakers with questionable records themselves .
â€ mr. almagro also criticized the politicians who were pushing for impeachment but facing corruption accusations themselves .
then mr. maluf won a seat in congress , giving him the privileged judicial standing that keeps nearly all senior brazilian politicians with such privileges out of jail .
despite mr. maluf â€™ s claims in recent days that he could travel outside brazil without being arrested , he remains wanted by interpol for the case against him in the united states , according to the united states justice department .
france also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a separate case involving organized money laundering .
scholars note the sweeping legal protections enjoyed by about 700 senior officials , including cabinet ministers and every member of congress .
â€ claims of misdeeds among other lawmakers do not bother some of the politicians wanting ms. rousseff impeached .
he resurrected his political career as a senator , only to face charges now of taking bribes in the graft scheme around the national oil company .
mr. collor â€™ s father , arnon de mello , set a precedent after fatally shooting a fellow senator on the senate floor in 1963 .
as tempers flare over impeachment , some cite the example of ivo cassol , a senator from the amazon .

the original deal held that big time would supply everything except the specially engineered critters â€” and the accompanying packets , which von braunhut would manufacture and sell separately to big time , which would then bundle the full kits and handle the sales .
also in the contract was a second deal â€” to buy the company , including the secret formula .
it allowed big time to pay a $ 5 million fee and then $ 5 million more in installments .
three winters ago , big time called up the widow and announced that it considered its previous payments for the packets to be a kind of layaway deal for the company and that , as far as big time was concerned , it now owned the franchise .
in a particularly contemporary twist to the melodrama , big time â€™ s court filings revealed that it was now buying knockoff from china .

remember amazing monsters ( a bald troll printed on a card that grew green mineral locks when watered ) ?
his crazy crabs were nothing more than hermit crabs in a little cardboard box , but the ad copy described another world : â€œ as gentle as a pussycat , it lives on land instead of water , does not bite unless mishandled .
â€ and : â€œ it loves to be touched and petted , and enjoys running from hand to hand , swinging from your fingers or just cuddling on your shoulder like an adorable tame parrot .
he spun off numerous whimsical books with all kinds of imaginary advice for caring for the tiny critters .
( inside joke for the arthropodologists : don â€™ t always need mates . )
there were timely variations of the toy .
there was a space kit , and a speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses .
the same equipment was repurposed into kits for fox hunt and mystery .

according to the judge , lefkowitz argued that the novelty â€™ s marketing included von braunhut â€™ s claim that â€œ are covered by â€˜ limited group life insurance policy .

â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ in the legal record , it â€™ s not clear that lefkowitz got any further than this legalistic tantrum , but signorelli von braunhut remembers a judge â€™ s coming down on the side of whimsy .
â€ but apparently , this fundamental question about was not settled .
he is a very powerful man in nashville , not only because he owns a toy company but also because his wife , beth harwell , is the speaker of the tennessee house of representatives .
in this affidavit , harwell explains precisely why he outsourced his to china .
he â€™ s practically picking up where lefkowitz left off by arguing that there is no there there , .
it â€™ s humbug .
and if the issues in harwell â€™ s affidavit go forward , then that is what may be on trial .
humbug .
when p. t. barnum , the great impresario of public entertainment ( and of the barnum bailey circus ) popularized that word â€” â€œ humbug â€ â€” he was talking exactly about things like .
but that overgeneralization misses barnum â€™ s sly nuance .
great humbug simply took off from a small truth and used that to show people what they wanted to see .
he understood that when you pit humbug against harsh cold reality , reality doesn â€™ t stand a chance .
humbug is as american as apple pie .
the case involved one of the biggest tourist attractions after the civil war : the 1869 discovery of the cardiff giant in a little town of that name near syracuse .
just as nowadays , there was an argument between rationalists and people of faith about the science of the bible , in this case , whether the giants described in the scriptures were real .
( people forget that the reason god flooded the entire earth during the time of noah is that angels and humans kept having lots of illicit sex and inadvertently created a race of deranged giants . )
so he sold the cardiff giant to a consortium of businessmen , headed by a man named david hannum .
p. t. barnum instantly offered the consortium $ 50 , 000 to buy the cardiff giant , no doubt convinced that humbug of this magnitude really deserved his marketing skills .
barnum had his own copy carved and rushed his giant to new york city .
and even as hull , the original forger , publicly confessed that the original giant was a fake , hannum took barnum to court .
the judge , of course , ruled in favor of barnum â€” you can â€™ t be sued for calling a fake a fake .
and it â€™ s understandable .

through a hallway crowded with scores of smiling angel dolls and various cherubim , we parted a few warming curtains to the living room and entered a cabinet of wonders .
whimsies abounded â€” on the table beside me , a snow white lamp , a bambi figurine , bobble heads .
josephine perched on her shoulder for the duration of my visit , occasionally striking angry bird poses and voicing some shrewd concern at my queries .

the image itself is famous .
you know it : a family with three antennas wagging on their heads and long paddle tails lounging outside their underwater castle .
so when you buy a kit , you get the tiny plastic aquarium and fitted into the sides are little magnifying lenses that enhance the tiny brine shrimp just enough , setting off a little motion picture in your head of primates swinging to and fro by their curved tails , gamboling in a watery jungle .
the real innovation may never have been the secret formula of his brine shrimp but the cognitive ignition of those four perfect words of distilled humbuggery : amazing live .

the officials have warned senators of diplomatic and economic fallout from the legislation .
adel the saudi foreign minister , delivered the kingdom â€™ s message personally last month during a trip to washington , telling lawmakers that saudi arabia would be forced to sell up to $ 750 billion in treasury securities and other assets in the united states before they could be in danger of being frozen by american courts .
but the threat is another sign of the escalating tensions between saudi arabia and the united states .
it is unclear whether the dispute over the sept. 11 legislation will be on the agenda for the talks .
a spokesman for the saudi embassy did not respond to a message seeking comment .
suspicions have lingered , partly because of the conclusions of a 2002 congressional inquiry into the attacks that cited some evidence that saudi officials living in the united states at the time had a hand in the plot .
the saudi military is flying jets and dropping bombs it bought from the united states â€” part of the billions of dollars in arms deals that have been negotiated with saudi arabia and other persian gulf nations during the obama administration .
current and former officials familiar with the negotiations called the timing of the transfer , which reduced the population at guantÃ¡namo to 80 prisoners , a coincidence .
that â€™ s why this is a major breakthrough .

2551,20131,272 slaves were sold to save georgetown .
what does it owe their descendants ?
- the new york times , new york times , rachel l. swarns,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0 , , '' washington â€” the human cargo was loaded on ships at a bustling wharf in the nation â€™ s capital , destined for the plantations of the deep south .
some slaves pleaded for rosaries as they were rounded up , praying for deliverance .
the enslaved had belonged to the nation â€™ s most prominent jesuit priests .
at georgetown , slavery and scholarship were inextricably linked .
( slaves were often donated by prosperous parishioners . )
3 million in today â€™ s dollars â€” was organized by two of georgetown â€™ s early presidents , both jesuit priests .
in november , the university agreed to remove the names of the rev .
an alumnus , following the protest from afar , wondered if more needed to be done .
mr. cellini is an unlikely racial crusader .
dr. rothman , the georgetown historian , heard about mr. cellini â€™ s efforts and let him know that he and several of his students were also tracing the slaves .
what has emerged from their research , and that of other scholars , is a glimpse of an insular world dominated by priests who required their slaves to attend mass for the sake of their salvation , but also whipped and sold some of them .
the enslaved were grandmothers and grandfathers , carpenters and blacksmiths , pregnant women and anxious fathers , children and infants , who were fearful , bewildered and despairing as they saw their families and communities ripped apart by the sale of 1838 .
the hope was to eventually identify the slaves â€™ descendants .
an inspector scrutinized the cargo on dec. 6 , 1838 .
but priests at the jesuit plantations recounted the panic and fear they witnessed when the slaves departed .
some children were sold without their parents , records show , and slaves were â€œ dragged off by force to the ship , â€ the rev .
but few were lucky enough to escape .
the rev .
the jesuits had sold off individual slaves before .
as early as the 1780s , dr. rothman found , they openly discussed the need to cull their stock of human beings .
but the decision to sell virtually all of their enslaved in the 1830s left some priests deeply troubled .
they also knew that life on plantations in the deep south was notoriously brutal , and feared that families might end up being separated and resold .
jan roothaan , who headed the jesuits â€™ international organization from rome and was initially reluctant to authorize the sale .
it would not survive , father mulledy feared , without an influx of cash .
so in june 1838 , he negotiated a deal with henry johnson , a member of the house of representatives , and jesse batey , a landowner in louisiana , to sell cornelius and the others .
in the uproar that followed , he was called to rome and reassigned .
some slaves suffered at the hands of a cruel overseer .
after the sale , cornelius vanishes from the public record until 1851 when his trail finally picks back up on a cotton plantation near maringouin , la .
the plantation would be sold again and again and again , records show , but cornelius â€™ s family remained intact .
in 1870 , he appeared in the census for the first time .
he was about 48 then , a father , a husband , a farm laborer and , finally , a free man .
it was his catholicism , born on the jesuit plantations of his childhood , that would provide researchers with a road map to his descendants .
his children and grandchildren also embraced the catholic church .
mr. cellini was on the line .
now , for the first time , ms. crump understood its origins .
â€œ oh my god .
â€ ms. crump is a familiar figure in baton rouge .
she prides herself on being unflappable .
mr. cellini , whose genealogists have already traced more than 200 of the slaves from maryland to louisiana , believes there may be thousands of living descendants .
( ms. discovered her connection through an earlier effort by the university to publish records online about the jesuit plantations . )
her ancestors , once amorphous and invisible , are finally taking shape in her mind .
there was no need for a map .
they were heading to the only catholic cemetery in maringouin .
they found the last physical marker of cornelius â€™ s journey at the immaculate heart of mary cemetery , where ms. crump â€™ s father , grandmother and are also buried .
the worn gravestone had toppled , but the wording was plain : â€œ neely hawkins died april 16 , 1902 .

now he is grounded in los angeles where he presides over a bespoke think tank , the berggruen institute .
the institute is a striking example of how wealthy philanthropists are reshaping the landscape with smaller versions of the foundations established by bill gates and george soros .
he is also a of the economic innovation group , which labels itself an â€œ ideas laboratory .
mr. berggruen stands out because he is a but player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious â€” a gatsby who shows up at his own parties .
there are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor .
â€ he cited the example of daniel guggenheim , who championed the rocketry pioneer robert goddard in the 1930s when he was widely dismissed as a crackpot .
mr. berggruen happens to be a davos habituÃ© , but his institute has a more eclectic mandate .
besides philosophy , he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the california budget .
he has established councils to study european integration and china .
mr. berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in brentwood , calif. and has commissioned the renowned swiss architecture firm herzog de meuron to design his institute â€™ s headquarters .

last november , mr. berggruen convened former prime ministers and other eminences in beijing to discuss the future of china .
â€œ he doesn â€™ t want anything from anybody , except to be of consequence .
the younger mr. berggruen attended le rosey , an exclusive swiss boarding school , and studied finance at new york university , but he says he began investing as a teenager , borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks .
forbes estimates his fortune to be about $ 1 .

and last month , he became a bachelor father .

he didn â€™ t invite personal confidences .
â€ mr. berggruen is courteous and even courtly : in restaurants , he stands when his date leaves the table .
but he isn â€™ t a schmoozer .
his stanford conference ran from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. with little time for small talk .
he was playful , but only on topic .
â€ mr. berggruen spoke proudly of the work his think long committee did to address california â€™ s deficit , including supporting proposition 31 , which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $ 25 million without finding the money for them .
mr. berggruen spent more than $ 1 million to get the proposition on the ballot .

such choices tend to be governed less by custom than by taste .

2564,20145 , volatility returns to oil market after opec deal fails - the new york times , new york times , jad mouawad,2016-04-20,2016.0,4.0 , , '' it â€™ s back to square 1 for the oil markets .
the failure of major producers to agree on an output freeze at a highly anticipated meeting in doha , qatar , this weekend underscored the still long and painful road to stabilize energy markets .
the news pushed down oil prices as traders were caught by the lack of agreement .
eager to increase oil output to its levels , iran had ruled out a production freeze and on the eve of the meeting decided not attend the doha gathering .
crude oil futures in new york fell 1 .
78 a barrel .
monday â€™ s declines were limited because of an oil workers â€™ strike in kuwait that significantly crimped production there .
the failure of the doha meeting highlighted once again that energy markets â€” and particularly oil â€” remained largely hostage to the rivalry between saudi arabia and iran for leadership and influence in the middle east .
but by producing full out , saudi arabia was also hurting other oil producers within opec , including iran and also russia , which is not an opec member .
at the time , saudi arabia , russia , qatar and venezuela had agreed in principle on a freeze but made it contingent on participation by other major producers .
at the same time , lower prices are beginning to bite .
5 million in the first half , the agency said in its monthly oil report released on thursday .
â€œ there is no doubt as to the direction of travel for the balance , â€ according to the energy adviser to industrialized nations .
â€œ there are signs that the slide in production of light , tight oil in the u. s. is gathering pace .
â€ â€œ the agreement would only have been of symbolic significance , in our view , and would not have altered the supply fundamentals , â€ according to the report .
president rafael correa cut short a visit to europe and declared a national emergency after the 7. earthquake struck on saturday night , shaking the central coast .

margaret lyons : i liked last season !
i liked this season , too , though i â€™ m in the minority because i absolutely hated â€œ the panic in central park , â€ where charlie and turns out to be a heroin addict .
i would have called it the best acting moment of the â€œ girls â€ season , but elijah â€™ s slow crumple as he realizes his dill is rejecting him might best it .
it was absolutely devastating , a sign of how much the show is pushing its characters to confront their desires â€” and ask themselves if the shiniest things are necessarily the best things .
it wrenched my heart right open â€” and showed off lena dunham â€™ s creation at its best .

side note â€” dunham â€™ s as a salty coffee barista have been so great .
( i â€™ d loop hannah â€™ s time in iowa in with that , too . )
she â€™ d be more confident , maybe , and more grounded .
( i wish we saw more of her schooling i bet she â€™ s an interesting classmate . )
for elijah , it â€™ s being vulnerable .
for hannah â€™ s dad , tad , it â€™ s being out .
out out .
for her mom , loreen , maybe it â€™ s being on her own after all .
so what is it for hannah ?
it â€™ s being free , even just for a little bit .
free of her own bad behavior : not flashing anyone , not sneaking off to have sex at the spa , not throwing herself at â€” or on â€” ray , not scolding her parents .
just chill .
for 10 minutes .
the moth bit was a refresher that hannah can actually be quite charming in those precious moments when she chooses to reflect .
and the ending , where we freeze on her leaping to action , felt like such a psychic correction from the season 2 finale , when adam raced to sweep hannah off her feet to the tune of fun â€” my personal â€œ girls â€ moment .
what do we think hannah is running toward in season 6 ?
it was hilarious !
the nude photo shoot was as excellent , just so classic hannah horvath .
and even though i loved jenny slate â€™ s cameo , the dance scene felt a little gratuitous ( but maybe i â€™ m just holding it up to the instant classic robyn scene from season 1 ) .
and isn â€™ t that enough ?
the more i think about it , the more i love how grotesque hannah has become .
jessa â€™ s passionate speech in the episode really cut to the quick for me â€” maybe there â€™ s something redemptive in the hot mess that is hannah horvath , even if we can â€™ t see it yet .
maybe there won â€™ t be a payoff .
maybe there doesn â€™ t need to be a grand revelation .
if there is , it might be inauthentic to who hannah has been this entire time .
i think i want to root for terrible , narcissistic women to take up as much space as terrible , narcissistic men .
and i can â€™ t picture that happening â€” that â€™ s just not what the show has ever been about .
what i liked most about hannah â€™ s interaction with her former nemesis tally was her gentle realization that she didn â€™ t have to stay friends with her friends .

she â€™ s flaky , and she has no whatsoever .
but unlike lots of other â€œ girls â€ viewers , i don â€™ t hate hannah .
i love the character , and i want hannah to have a life she wants .
you want to be a demanding , inappropriate narcissist forever ?
embrace it .
ah i somewhat hate all of these people .

you are me , watching â€œ girls .

this is hannah â€™ s nightmare scenario : doing normal person stuff .
justice sonia sotomayor said that â€œ nearly 11 million unauthorized aliens are here in the shadows .
but justice kennedy questioned whether the president can defer deportations for millions of people without specific congressional authorization .
â€œ that â€™ s just upside down .
â€ the case , united states v. texas , no .
concerns a program intended to allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and providing them work permits .
the program , announced in november 2014 , was called deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents , or dapa .
mr. verrilli told the justices that it addressed â€œ a pressing humanitarian concern in avoiding the breakup of families that contain u. s. citizen children .
mr. verrilli said that was â€œ a million miles from where we are now .
but what they can â€™ t do is grant authorization to be in the country .
â€ he said the states â€™ quarrel was with what he called a blanket grant of â€œ lawful presence â€ to millions of immigrants , entitling them to various benefits .
â€œ correct , â€ mr. verrilli responded .
â€œ i just don â€™ t understand it .
â€ ''
the case also pits the obama administration â€™ s view â€” that it â€™ s time to grant relief from deportation to a substantial fraction of the country â€™ s 11 million undocumented immigrants â€” against conservative opposition to any reform that smacks of amnesty .
the case is obviously drenched in politics .
â€ but after congress failed to pass the dream act , which would have provided a path to permanent residency for undocumented immigrants who came to the united states as children , in the summer of 2012 obama found the executive power he previously denied having and signed an order called deferred action for childhood arrival , modeled on the dream act .
more than a million people qualified .
there â€™ s a view of these orders , which you â€™ ve expressed in the past : the government chooses how to enforce laws , and whom to deport , all the time .
it â€™ s called prosecutorial discretion .
obama â€™ s critics also accuse him of wielding his magic pen for partisan gain .
this political debate intersects with some of the legal arguments before the supreme court .
where does prosecutorial discretion end and unfaithful execution begin ?
what do you think ?
to protect us from the might of the federal government , the founders agreed that any coercive action must be authorized both by congress ( which passes a law ) and the executive ( which enforces it ) .
in law as in ethics , â€œ ought â€ implies â€œ can .
the democrats , by contrast , have woken up to the weakness of congress .
the rules and traditions of that august body give small groups of representatives , acting on behalf of a tiny segment of the population , the power to block reform that nearly everyone agrees is needed .
here , too , we detect the fingerprints of the founders , who feared tyranny by legislative majorities .
for most of our history , majorities in congress bought off the minority with logrolling , pork and the like .
can the supreme court clean up this mess ?
definitely not .
but the idea that roberts is a traitor to the conservative movement is hugely unfair to him .
in their hands .
but i â€™ m skeptical .
the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed .
what do you think ?
your neighbor can â€™ t , even if he loves your dog or belongs to the a. s. p. c. a .
( nor does your dog , for what it â€™ s worth . )
when the government acts , however , things become more complicated .
can you sue now ?
with a bunch of exceptions not relevant here , citizens can â€™ t sue the government for doing things they don â€™ t like , or not doing the things they want to see done â€” and this is true even if it turns out that the government â€™ s actions or inactions violate the law .
the â€œ injury â€ analysis becomes more complicated for governments .
is texas â€œ injured â€ if the federal government refuses to deport undocumented immigrants on texas soil even though no specific texan is ?
maybe or maybe not .
citing this case , the fifth circuit majority in our current case argued that the cost of supplying driver â€™ s licenses would erode texas â€™ s budget .
not surprisingly , in the fifth circuit , it was the liberal dissenter who argued that texas lacked standing and the conservative majority that argued that texas possessed standing .
â€™ s failure to regulate and the disappearance of another chunk of cape cod into the atlantic ocean .
this tempting bit of legal jujitsu might just do the trick .

add them up , all the pet dogs on the planet , and you get about 250 million .
but there are about a billion dogs on earth , according to some estimates .
the other 750 million don â€™ t have flea collars .
and they certainly don â€™ t have humans who take them for walks and pick up their feces .
, â€ raymond and lorna coppinger argue that if you really want to understand the nature of dogs , you need to know these other animals .
other scientists disagree about the genetics of the dogs , but acknowledge that of a billion dogs are well worth studying .
the coppingers have been major figures in canine science for decades .
both had dogs as children .
lorna had several kinds .
it was reputedly a mix .
he also developed a winning strain by hybridizing alaskan village dogs with border collies .
like jane .
â€ the last , who died in 2013 , was poppyseed shackleton , a jack russell terrier who belonged to their grandchildren , but lived with them .
instead , they argued , dogs domesticated themselves .
some wild canines started hanging around humans for their leftovers and gradually evolved into scavengers dependent on humans .
so we started to study them .
â€ that was in the early 1990s .
they are completely polygamous .
and after about 10 weeks , the puppies fend for themselves .
most of the pups don â€™ t survive , as is the case with many wild animals .
they have remarkably varied connections to human beings .
some live completely on their own at dumps .
others may feed and breed on their own , but spend nights at the homes of people .
sometimes they are adopted by people .
the coppingers calculated that in the tropics it takes about 100 people to produce enough garbage to support seven dogs .
but some scientists have tracked their behavior .
wolf puppies depend on their parents and other adults regurgitating partly digested food .
it does happen , but reports suggest that in village dogs it may occur several times a week .
â€œ they need to walk up to a rotten melon and eat it , which they can do at 10 weeks .
they can convince a human to feed them .
â€ but what are village dogs ?
are they a breed , or a superbreed apart ?
adam boyko , a biologist at the cornell university college of veterinary medicine , who was inspired to pursue canine science by the coppingers â€™ 2001 book , has also compiled dna from village dogs around the world .
he concluded that these dogs were different from purebreds and mixed breeds .
he also found that modern european street dogs trace their ancestry to east asian dogs that migrated with humans to europe .
they represent a treasure trove of scientific information .
it â€™ s impossible to kill them all , and because they breed rapidly , the population quickly rebounds .
what to do ?
the coppingers suggest a simple answer .

the union â€™ s law firm on monday filed a petition covering raw aluminum imports with an american trade panel .
the petition invokes section 201 of the 1974 trade act .
a section 201 case covers essentially all imports of a product from all over the world .
but section 201 cases are also harder to win .
section 201 cases are reviewed by the united states international trade commission , a bipartisan , group of trade experts in washington .
the office of the united states trade representative declined to comment on the union â€™ s contentions .
the result has been a surge in exports and falling prices for aluminum .
smelters in canada and elsewhere , having been displaced in their traditional international markets , have stepped up shipments of raw aluminum to the united states .
other factors are influencing the aluminum trade .
we haven â€™ t seen the petition and look forward to reviewing it .

2584,20167 , israeli convicted in murder of palestinian teenager - the new york times , new york times , isabel kershner,2016-04-20,2016.0,4.0 , , '' jerusalem â€” an israeli court convicted a man on tuesday of abducting and murdering a palestinian teenager in 2014 , rejecting his insanity plea and bringing to a close a case that has convulsed israelis and palestinians .
mr. told investigators during a recorded of the crime that he had urged his young relatives , who struggled with their captive in the back of the car , to â€œ finish him off .
their bodies were found in a shallow grave on a west bank hillside after a wrenching search .
the kidnappings and killings roiled israeli and palestinian emotions , touched off riots in east jerusalem and contributed to a spiral of tensions and violence culminating in the gaza war that ended in august 2014 .
â€ â€œ we are tired of this , â€ he added .
mr. a resident of a west bank settlement who ran a glasses store in jerusalem , did not testify during his trial .
the psychiatrist told the court that while mr. understood what he was doing at the time of the crime , the manic and psychotic symptoms he displayed in the past might have affected his ability to control his actions .
the prosecution argued that mr. had worked up until the time of the killing , including that evening , and had acted normally and rationally during and after the episode .
a israeli psychiatrist found that mr. was aware of his actions and was not psychotic at the time of the crime , and the court agreed .
â€œ he burned the victim while he was alive , all motivated by crazed revenge .
â€ the jerusalem district court also convicted on tuesday an israeli man , yishai schlissel , of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder for his deadly stabbing rampage at the city â€™ s gay pride parade in july , when he killed shira banki , a jewish girl .
march was also the 11th consecutive month to set a record high for temperatures , which agencies started tracking in the 1800s .

the small silences in this episode are rich and absorptive .
they â€™ re there to see adam perform as half of a squabbling married couple , but by the time the play reaches its grisly climax , none of these people are really paying attention .
they ignore the screams and barely notice the amateurish plaster statues that stand in for the victim and her killer .
there â€™ s just brenda lee misting up the soundtrack .
the camera glides toward windows .
it cranes downs at the plaster .
it oscillates from jessa to adam to hannah .
perhaps you think about â€œ rear window , â€ â€œ monsieur hire , â€ â€œ stakeout â€ or any other movie involving voyeurism , danger and a little melodrama .

hannah performs her pain for the storytellers â€™ radio hour â€œ the moth , â€ which obviously she takes to like a to a flame .

they had to try something .
all right ?

2599,20182 , '' dish network and viacom sign a deal , ending a standoff - the new york times '' , new york times , emily steel,2016-04-22,2016.0,4.0 , , '' dish network wanted its mtv after all .
on thursday morning , dish , the satellite tv provider , and viacom announced that they had struck a multiyear agreement for dish to continue to carry viacom â€™ s bundle of television networks , averting a threatened blackout .
packages for specific genres of programming also are available for an additional monthly fee .
specific terms of the deal were not disclosed .
viacom â€™ s stock surged with the news .
by midday thursday , viacom shares were up nearly 10 percent .
on friday morning , world leaders will gather again at the united nations for a grand ceremony to sign the document .
after a of failed diplomatic efforts , signs are growing that nations have turned a corner in their political willingness to tackle climate change .
the falling cost of clean energy is providing a powerful tailwind for their efforts .
no country has shared a detailed , credible strategy to achieve what scientists think is necessary : ending the era of emissions and converting entirely to clean energy no later than the middle of this century .
â€œ whether it will happen in time to head off dangerous climate change is really the question .
and oil and gas companies continue to invest billions of dollars a year searching for new reserves of fossil fuels .
all those factors mean that a goal established by the governments of the world in 2009 â€” limiting the warming of the planet to 3 .
the fight over a nominee to the supreme court is , in part , a fight over the fate of the clean power plan , which is intended to limit emissions from power plants in the united states .
the rhodium group , an economic consulting firm , has calculated that mr. obama â€™ s plans may reduce emissions by only 23 percent or so .
the french minister of environment and energy , sÃ©golÃ¨ne royal , alluded to the importance of the american presidential election during a meeting on monday with reporters at the united nations , saying the agreement might be â€œ signed and ratified by the time anybody is elected .
â€ at that moment , the french ambassador to the united nations , franÃ§ois delattre , uttered a stage whisper within the earshot of several reporters .
â€ for all the lingering political uncertainty , however , the economics of clean energy appear to be improving so rapidly that a radical acceleration of the energy transition may become possible , if governments push it along with new policies .
2601,20184 , volkswagen reaches deal in u.s. over emissions scandal - the new york times , new york times , jack ewing,2016-04-23,2016.0,4.0 , , '' volkswagen agreed on thursday to fix or buy back nearly 500 , 000 diesel cars in the united states that are equipped with illegal emissions software .
but a settlement announced in federal court in san francisco left open numerous legal and financial issues stemming from the carmaker â€™ s admission that it rigged diesel vehicles to cheat on pollution tests .
judge charles r. breyer set june 21 as the deadline for volkswagen to settle those questions with the federal government as well as lawyers for vehicle owners .
it is already clear , though , that volkswagen will have to increase the amount it has set aside to cover costs of the emissions scandal , which will easily run into billions of dollars .
kelley blue book , a research firm , has estimated the cost of buying back all the cars in the united states at $ 7 billion .
the company is certain to face additional billions in fines and compensation paid to owners beyond the costs of repairs or buybacks in the united states .
and there are many more faulty cars in europe and elsewhere in the world still to be dealt with .
volkswagen has set aside only 6 .
7 billion euros , or $ 7 .
â€œ if they agree to buy back the cars , the costs will be higher than the current provisions , â€ said matthias hellstern , managing director for corporate finance at moody â€™ s investors service in frankfurt .
kevin helmich , owner of a 2010 audi a3 with a diesel engine , said on thursday that he would lean toward having the company buy his car back rather than get it repaired .
but he added , â€œ i probably wouldn â€™ t buy another car from them .
â€ volkswagen faces a theoretical maximum government fine of $ 18 billion in the united states .
legal experts expect the legal penalties to be much lower , but still in the billions .
under the agreement announced thursday , the company will offset some of the environmental damage caused by the cars by investing in clean technologies .
it should also help volkswagen restore some good will with owners of 480 , 000 volkswagens and audi a3 models with the affected diesel engines .
the models with the cheating software in the united states include volkswagen , audi and porsche cars with or diesel engines from the model years .
but a solution for about 100 , 000 cars with diesel engines , including audi and porsche models , has not yet been agreed to , the judge indicated .
â€ many more european cars , over 10 million , are also affected by the volkswagen cheating .
it faces official investigations and possible criminal proceedings in other countries , including britain , france , germany and south korea .
and owners of its models in europe , who account for a vast majority of the 11 million diesel vehicles with the cheating software , are angry that they are not receiving any compensation .
but it has balked at offering european owners money .
analysts at the investment bank ubs had estimated the total cost of the scandal for volkswagen at 38 billion euros , or about $ 43 .
1 billion , of which â‚¬14 billion was for expenses outside the united states .
judge breyer had given volkswagen until thursday to reach a settlement with the federal government and with vehicle owners in the united states .
the defeat device allowed volkswagen to cheat on the emissions tests in the united states by recognizing when cars were being monitored and changing the exhaust settings .
in testing , the cars increased pollution controls .
but on the road , pollution controls were scaled back to enhance performance and fuel mileage , and to protect emissions equipment from wear .
when that happened , the cars spewed as much as 40 times the allowed amounts of nitrogen oxides , a pollutant that poses health hazards .
judge breyer is overseeing almost all of the litigation in the united states , including claims filed by federal and state governments as well as volkswagen owners .
the states have not yet filed a suit against volkswagen .
volkswagen â€™ s legal troubles were focused in the united states because limits on nitrogen oxides are more stringent and the penalties more severe than in europe .
rob martens , a retired musician in boulder , colo. said he was eager to have volkswagen buy back his 2015 passat diesel .
while he likes the car â€™ s roominess and ride , he â€™ s not happy to be driving a car that emits more pollutants than it should .

1 million vehicles that can roll away unexpectedly and cause injuries when the transmission is not used properly , adding to a spate of recent safety actions by carmakers .
this year â€™ s total is unlikely to match the record of more than 60 million vehicles set in 2014 after general motors recalled millions of small cars with faulty ignitions that were ultimately linked to 124 deaths .
g. m. and other automakers , including fiat chrysler , have been subject to heavy fines by regulators for failing to promptly fix defective vehicles .
in recent weeks , g. m. announced a major recall to fix seatbelts in its trucks , and other companies have announced safety actions to repair faulty airbags .
the recall blitz has even included the electric carmaker tesla motors , which said last week that it would recall its new model x sport utility vehicle to prevent seats from folding forward in a collision .
the automaker also will recall more than 300 , 000 vehicles for similar problems in various international markets , including canada and mexico .
the vehicles affected include jeep grand cherokee s. u. v. and dodge charger and chrysler 300 sedans .
an investigation by the carmaker and the national highway traffic safety administration found that drivers were leaving their vehicles without shifting the transmission into the â€œ park â€ position when the engine was running .
â€œ unless due care is taken , drivers may draw erroneous conclusions about the status of their vehicles , â€ fiat chrysler said .
among the injuries were a fractured pelvis , broken ribs , cuts , sprains and severe bruising .
regulators also found that shifters in the affected vehicles were unreasonably difficult to operate .

unsurprisingly , the thing about prince and sex is that you have to be in the mood .
â€ â€œ tambourine â€ has a tight funk that rattles and thrums .
and the screaming is ecstatic .
even better was the slinkier funk of â€œ hot thing , â€ which appears on 1987 â€™ s â€œ sign o â€™ the times .
â€ it â€™ s hard to overstate the importance of screaming to prince â€™ s hotness .
it means something .
he , madonna , and michael jackson are the biggest and most important pop stars of the 1980s and early â€™ 90s , and of the three , it â€™ s prince who could really embed different expressions of lust in his songwriting .
madonna embodied it .
but i don â€™ t know that prince wanted control .
so i didn â€™ t spend much time with that song until i was an adult .
it wasn â€™ t until i took a long drive with a friend that i actually heard â€œ darling nikki .
â€ we listened to â€œ purple rain â€ four times .
we heard the screaming .
it wasn â€™ t from an orgasm but from pain .
he â€™ s wailing .
prince eventually expunged the song from his live repertoire .
he â€™ d become more conservative and more religious .
raspberry berets for everybody !
he would also spread the boasting around .
but the hot thing ?
that â€™ s u . ''
that was it .
he was impromptu .
the last time i saw amy winehouse was when she performed with prince .
he loved talent .
â€ for many in the fashion world , the film and album â€œ purple rain â€ became their gateway to a lifelong connection to prince , as both a performer and role model .
part of what i also loved was that not only did he do great music but he was smaller than the other musicians and he always got the girl .
it was the most brilliant thing i ever heard .
in time there were comparisons to another great superstar of his time : michael jackson .
but prince was different .
adept not just as a singer , guitarist , keyboard player and dancer , he was also virtually unmatched in his ability to destabilize people both privately and publicly .
â€œ he was pop , with clean lyrics .
prince was not scared .
the first time i heard someone sing about aids it was prince : â€˜ in france , a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name. â€™ he was not afraid of taboos .
â€ that fearlessness extended to his costumes , which were further exercises in contradiction and gender ambiguity .
among those in attendance was the designer joseph altuzarra .
â€œ i think more than anyone , really , prince felt like he was above it all â€” just such a legend , a living legend .
i â€™ ve definitely looked at his style pictures .
â€™ â€ â€œ i am crying , â€ she added .

he was 57 .
emergency medical workers attempted to provide lifesaving cpr , but were unable to revive the victim .
a grammy winner , prince had top 10 hits like â€œ little red corvette , â€ â€œ when doves cry , â€ â€œ let â€™ s go crazy , â€ â€œ kiss â€ and â€œ the most beautiful girl in the world â€ albums like â€œ dirty mind , â€ â€œ 1999 â€ and â€œ sign o â€™ the times â€ were statements .
his songs also became hits for others , among them â€œ nothing compares 2 u â€ for sinead o â€™ connor , â€œ manic monday â€ for the bangles and â€œ i feel for you â€ for chaka khan .
with the 1984 film and album â€œ purple rain , â€ he told a fictionalized version of his own story : biracial ( although prince â€™ s parents were both ) gifted , spectacularly ambitious .
its music won him an academy award , and the album sold more than 13 million copies in the united states alone .
â€ he added , â€œ he was a virtuoso instrumentalist , a brilliant bandleader , and an electrifying performer .
â€ prince recorded the great majority of his music entirely on his own , playing every instrument and singing every vocal line .
he would often follow a arena concert with a club show , pouring out even more music .
elsewhere in his catalog were songs that addressed social issues and delved into mysticism and science fiction .
yet for musicians and listeners of multiple generations , he was admired universally .
he sang as a soul belter , a rocker , a bluesy ballad singer and a falsetto crooner .
his music was a cornucopia of ideas : triumphantly , brilliantly kaleidoscopic .
they were separated in 1965 , and his mother remarried in 1967 .
prince spent some time living with each parent and immersed himself in music , teaching himself to play his instruments .
â€œ i think you â€™ ll always be able to do what your ear tells you , â€ he told his high school newspaper , according to the biography â€œ i would die 4 u : why prince became an icon â€ ( 2013 ) by the critic tourÃ© .
eventually he ran away , living for some time in the basement of a neighbor whose son , andrÃ© anderson , would later record as andrÃ© cymone .
he recorded with a minneapolis band , 94 east , and began working on his own solo recordings .
he was still a teenager when he was signed to warner bros. records , in a deal that included full creative control .
his first album , â€œ for you â€ ( 1978 ) gained only modest attention .
but his second , â€œ prince â€ ( 1979 ) started with â€œ i wan na be your lover , â€ a no .
1 rb hit that reached no .
with his third album , the pointedly titled â€œ dirty mind , â€ prince moved from typical rb romance to raunchier , more graphic scenarios he posed on the cover against a backdrop of bedsprings and added more rock guitar to his music .
â€œ controversy , â€ in 1981 , had prince taunting , â€œ am i black or white ?

1 album , single and film simultaneously .
he also drew some opposition .
prince didn â€™ t try to repeat the blockbuster sound of â€œ purple rain , â€ and for a time he withdrew from performing .
he also built his studio complex , paisley park , in the for a reported $ 10 million , and in 1989 his â€œ batman â€ soundtrack album sold two million copies .
â€œ sign o â€™ the times , â€ a monumental 1987 album that addressed politics and religion as well as romance , was a set , cut back from a triple .
he was an indefatigable performer : posing , dancing , taking a turn at every instrument , teasing a crowd and then dazzling it .
he defied a downpour to play a triumphal â€œ purple rain â€ at the super bowl halftime show in 2007 , and he headlined the coachella festival in 2008 for a reported $ 5 million .

she was wearing a gray tomasz starzewski jacket bought on sale more than 40 years ago , drinking tea from a tankard ( an ebay find ) and discussing her recovery from her weekly lottery addiction .
on her feet were what looked like roger vivier court shoes , but when a reporter suggested she might like to remove whatever was stuck to the bottom of them before having her photograph taken , lady elizabeth , 75 , handed the footwear to her liveried butler .
and really , why shouldn â€™ t she be ?
among her â€œ grander family , â€ as she calls them , frugality is a trait to be celebrated .
the queen has been known to take public trains .
kate middleton , the duchess of cambridge ( whom lady elizabeth refers to as â€œ catherine â€ ) is applauded for wearing dresses more than once .
if she were to start again , the sitting room would rebuke her .

â€™ â€ on the subject of her majesty : for the record , the queen is a â€œ most meticulous hostess , â€ though she does not insist only on malvern water or yellow freesias , as has been reported .
â€ in fact , it was a gardener at windsor castle who decreed the yellow flowers .
â€ while looking at wedding sites with the actress isla fisher , who was marrying sacha baron cohen , lady elizabeth was amused that ms. fisher ( code name : sally dangletrot ) kept three different wigs in the car to disguise herself .

it shows the complications for law enforcement agents who confront an overeager amateur encroaching on their turf .

in an interview last week , mr. lopez â€™ s voice broke as he described his prison ordeal .
â€ by his own admission , mr. lopez knew almost nothing about the islamic state before 2014 .
as he put it , nobody knew he was â€œ little toby , the car salesman from delaware .
by early november 2014 , he had left his job , agreeing with his boss that his online life had become a distraction .
the man who claimed to be the islamic state commander regaled him with tales of battle , grumbled about condescending arab bosses and called mr. lopez â€œ brother .
it was beyond our comprehension .
through allan ripp , a new york public relations specialist he found online , mr. lopez also contacted the new york times .
but after checking with experts , the reporters concluded that mr. lopez was talking not to the real , mr. shishani , but to an impostor .
the actual commander did not speak fluent english , and the language overheard in the background of skype calls was not chechen , as the impostor claimed , but kurdish .
when the times reporters told mr. lopez they did not believe he was dealing with the real islamic state commander , he grew angry .
his online contacts had suggested that she might be freed .

except the woman at this net also has a bone to pick with her spouse , jay z .
â€œ lemonade â€ is less a dramatization than a daydream , infused with black magic , embracing â€” if only notionally â€” african tribalism , science fiction , menstruation and witchcraft .
the music â€™ s emotional odyssey is conjugal .
( the song chapters are presented as stages â€” â€œ intuition , â€ â€œ denial , â€ â€œ forgiveness , â€ â€œ hope , â€ etc . )
throughout , black women are standing , sitting , phalanxed on the porches of what feel like plantations and antiquated houses , rich with pain .
the mothers of slain young men exude regal stoicism , holding photographs of their sons .
visually , â€œ lemonade â€ invokes a lot â€” madonna â€™ s â€œ la isla bonita , â€ â€œ carrie , â€ â€œ beasts of the southern wild â€ and the at the end of michael jackson â€™ s â€œ black or white .

on a different occasion , she sang : â€œ to the left , to the left .
â€ that all feels pedestrian now .
beyoncÃ© â€™ s prized possessions here are her trust , love and dignity .
but she â€™ s daring to think beyond herself .
the heavy hangover of the piece involves what lots of men have done to lots of women , black women in particular .
you have to split open a lot of citrus , remove the seeds , strain for pulp and add a lot of sugar .
the arrival of that record , the debut of a video for â€œ formation â€ last super bowl eve and the premiere of â€œ lemonade â€ have put her atop the complex in a way that rivals madonna , janet and michael jackson .

feelings gush like water .

adele declined to stream her blockbuster album â€œ 25 â€ on any service , and taylor swift removed all her albums from spotify before the release of â€œ 1989 , â€ her latest album , which is available on apple music , the company â€™ s streaming service .
as a partner in tidal â€” the service that her husband , jay z , bought just over a year ago for $ 56 million and reintroduced as an alternative to spotify â€” beyoncÃ© faced a strong incentive to release the album exclusively through that outlet , to draw attention to the service and attract subscribers to it .

it was evening , and when the police arrived , they saw the man pacing the beach and called to him .
he responded by throwing a rock at the embankment where they stood .
they shouted to him from a sheriff â€™ s boat he threw another rock .
he started to leave the beach , and after warning him , they shot him in the leg with a beanbag gun .
and on that sunday last summer , the police here chose a different course .
a search at daylight found no signs of him .
people with mental illnesses are overrepresented among civilians involved in police shootings : percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder , according to various analyses .
similar encounters have occurred in albuquerque , dallas , indianapolis and other cities .
for the approach to be effective , it needs the full backing of a police department â€™ s leadership , continual checks on its effectiveness , and collaboration with the mental health community .
â€ the decision by the portland police to leave the man on the beach was controversial within the department .
but after more troubling instances involving the mentally ill , a justice department investigation concluded in 2012 that the police bureau had shown â€œ a pattern or practice of unnecessary or unreasonable force during interactions with people who have or are perceived to have mental illness .
â€ now they are encouraged to question whether â€œ that â€ is really necessary .
jails around the country have filled with mentally ill inmates who , unable to obtain treatment in the community , are arrested time and again for minor offenses like disorderly conduct and petty theft .
bizarre behavior is often interpreted as a prelude to violence .
and routine police actions aimed at control â€” placing a hand on a person â€™ s shoulder , for example â€” can backfire with someone with a severe mental illness .

instead of buying the iphone 6s , he has been waiting to see what the next iphone looks like , and he said he might even switch to a model by a different maker .
in china , where apple has been a signifier of wealth and fashion , and where many chinese update their smartphones each year , mr. yu is not an outlier .
apple â€™ s earnings report on tuesday showed how hard it can be to keep the attention of china â€™ s fickle and increasingly consumers .
that being the case , apple will have to fight to maintain its dominance of the high end of the market .
apple also faces other obstacles in china .
last week , the company â€™ s ibooks store and itunes movies services were shut down by a chinese regulator , just six months after they started operating .
the deal contributed to chinese consumers spending $ 59 billion on apple products in the latest fiscal year .
but even the illegal sellers are feeling the pressure .
the iphone â€™ s weaker sales also reflect the broader slowdown in growth in china â€™ s enormous smartphone market .
â€œ if you look at the entire market , apple can not fight off so many competitors , like samsung and local brands like huawei and oppo , â€ he said .
â€œ they â€™ re all trying to raise the average selling price , and that will bleed into apple â€™ s sales flow .
â€ despite the pressure , mr. cook said in the earnings call on tuesday that apple was â€œ optimistic â€ about china , even if it was losing ground .
there is even a precedent for an apple recovery : in 2012 and 2013 , the company â€™ s sales growth in china slowed as competitors like samsung offered phones with larger screens , which are very popular in china .
for mo chen , a public relations professional who owns an iphone 5 , the next apple smartphone will have to do much more than her current model for her to be tempted .

2644,20228 , where did the government jobs go ?
- the new york times , new york times , annie lowrey,2016-10-18,2016.0,10.0 , , '' on a muggy afternoon in april , angelina iles , 65 , folded herself into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of her beloved pineville , la .
when employers leave towns like pineville , they often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments .
but in the case of huey p. long , the employer was the government itself .
at the time , louisiana was flush with federal funds for hurricane katrina reconstruction and running a budget surplus .
during his failed bid for the presidency last year , he boasted that bureaucrats are now an endangered species in louisiana .
â€ he laid off more than just bureaucrats .
but it was all for naught .
earlier , iles had introduced me to another friend , linette richard , whose story was similar .
we don â€™ t have positions available .
but at the same time , jobs have been shrinking at every level of government , with local offices losing 10 , 600 workers , the state government 31 , 900 and the federal government 1 , 600 .
louisiana is an exaggerated case , but the pattern persists when you look at the country as a whole .
since the recession hit , private employers have added five million jobs and the government has lost 323 , 000 .
the country has recovered from the recession .
the public sector has long been home to the sorts of jobs that lift people into the middle class and keep them there .
these are jobs that have predictable hours , stable pay and protection from arbitrary layoffs , particularly for those without college or graduate degrees .
they â€™ re also more likely to be unionized less than 7 percent of workers are represented by a union , while more than a third of those in the public sector are .
â€œ we felt middle class , â€ richard told me .
â€œ now we feel kind of lower .
and the share of government jobs held by women climbed 70 percent between 1964 and 1974 , and nearly another 30 percent by the early 1980s .
â€œ the inability to fire people in a fashion has likely protected who are perhaps likely to be fired in a fashion , â€ she says .
and regardless of their income , black families were much more likely to be rejected for conventional mortgages and pushed into subprime loans .
â€œ it may be that black workers are more likely to be laid off when the layoffs are triggered by a sudden and significant reduction in funding , â€ she wrote .
â€ as a result of all these economic punishments , a recession that set america back half a decade may have set black families back a whole generation , if not longer .
and because the public sector provides so many essential services , cuts to it have a cascading effect .
angelina iles , the retiree i met in pineville , cited the loss of dental , and emergency medical services as being a particularly profound problem for her community .
other states and towns are electing to have smaller public work forces .
with time , government jobs should come back that pathway to the middle class should grow again .
â€œ you can â€™ t enjoy retirement in this situation .

giving those seats to starboard may also remove some additional doubts about the seriousness of yahoo â€™ s intent in exploring a sale , a process that several people involved have described as messy and confusing .
the hedge fund had latched on to those concerns as part of its activism campaign .
at the same time that a settlement has been reached , yahoo and its board are still combing through the preliminary bids received last week .
among them were proposals from verizon communications , seen as the early leader in the sales process , and from investment firms like tpg capital , silver lake and a consortium led by bain capital and vista equity partners .
a succession of chief executives , the latest being the google veteran marissa mayer , have failed to find an effective answer .

â€ ms. nelson â€™ s petition also listed five as heirs , and asked the court to appoint a special administrator for the estate â€œ because no personal representative has been appointed in minnesota or elsewhere .
â€ minnesota law treats surviving the same as full siblings , raising the possibility of a family battle .
â€ a lawyer for ms. nelson did not respond to requests for comment .
the probate court has not identified an executor , and estimates of prince â€™ s net worth and of the value of his estate have varied widely .

8 million tracks in the united states , according to nielsen .
its value is unclear , but paisley park , his studio complex in the suburb of chanhassen , minn. has been assessed at over $ 7 million , according to carver county public records .
prince was known to be exacting in his dealings with record companies , and fought hard to retain as much control as possible .
a police investigation is continuing .
a frequent comparison has been to the estate of michael jackson , who was badly in debt when he died in 2009 but had a will that estate has since earned hundreds of millions of dollars .
if you don â€™ t take care of it , you â€™ re leaving a mess to the family or the courts .

in return for a personal payout estimated at $ 420 million , mr. katzenberg , 65 , will reluctantly step aside , having never quite managed to become that kingpin .
others wondered if mr. katzenberg was positioning himself for an ambassadorship should hillary clinton win the presidency .
there is also the possibility that mr. katzenberg could follow mr. geffen â€™ s example and turn to philanthropy .
he initially agreed to speak to a reporter .
at a 10 a. m. meeting on thursday for dreamworks animation â€™ s 1 , 500 employees , held near a monumental fountain on the studio â€™ s campus in glendale , calif. mr. katzenberg struck an upbeat tone , according to attendees .

mr. roberts placed a call to mr. katzenberg , who immediately picked up the phone .

dreamworks was founded shortly after mr. katzenberg left a senior disney job amid deteriorating relations with then its chief executive , michael eisner .

the couple then died in a shootout with the police .
federal officials have said that mr. marquez also admitted that in exchange for money , and as a favor to the farooks , he entered into a fraudulent marriage with a russian immigrant , mariya chernykh , so she could gain legal residence in the united states .
on thursday , federal prosecutors in los angeles announced felony charges against ms. chernykh , 26 , her sister , tatiana farook , 31 , and ms. farook â€™ s husband , syed raheel farook , 31 , the brother of the san bernardino gunman .
law enforcement officials stressed they did not believe that any of the three had advance knowledge of the december attack , or took steps to conceal evidence afterward , but that major investigations often lead to the discovery of unrelated offenses .
the f. b. i. continues to comb through the backgrounds of the san bernardino attackers , looking for motives and possible accomplices , and until recently the bureau was engaged in a very public legal battle with apple over syed rizwan farook â€™ s cellphone .

the indictment , announced thursday , represents an unusually tough stance for the government in a marriage fraud case .

my most favorite sandwich is fried eggplant , mozzarella and roast beef on an italian hero , with hot peppers and a slash of mayonnaise .
it is a beautiful torpedo of food â€” crunchy , silken , sweet and spicy all at once .
but be careful .
it is huge and outrageously rich .
if you consume it all at once , it can be the sort of sandwich to lay out the afternoon in stages of grief .
i always eat the whole thing and hate myself through my untouched dinner later in the day .
to start , fry the eggplant .
i use small italian eggplants , eight to 10 inches in length , with dark , shiny skins , firm to the touch .
then i cut the eggplants into thin planks and salt them awhile , not so much because they â€™ re bitter but because the salt draws moisture from the flesh , collapsing its cell structure and reducing the amount of oil the eggplant picks up when it cooks .
( some old recipes for fried eggplant call for a dip in bread crumbs following the egg , but i think this is overkill . )
let the eggplant drain a little , and the planks will keep , lightly covered , for a few hours on the countertop or for a few days in the fridge .
( vegetarians can avoid the roast beef . )
lastly , you â€™ ll need pickled italian hot cherry peppers , which you can slice into rounds and apply as desired .
the mayonnaise is my preference .
i know some people hate it .
so wherever you come down on the question of mayonnaise , follow your decision with a small stack of fried eggplant on the sandwich â€™ s bottom , followed by another of sliced mozzarella and another of roast beef , then top the whole with the cherry peppers .
for today , at least .
â€œ no chance .

â€ mr. obama â€™ s most personal jab at a journalist was aimed at jake tapper , the host of â€œ the lede â€ on cnn .
â€œ hillary once questioned whether i â€™ d be ready for a 3 a. m. phone call , â€ he recalled .
â€ he dropped his microphone , and turned from the podium . ''
and yet , by his own assessment , those efforts were vastly underappreciated .
â€œ we were moving so fast early on that we couldn â€™ t take victory laps .
â€œ i mean , the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter , â€ he said , â€œ then we might have maintained a majority in the house or the senate .
as he tried to sum up his economic legacy in florida , our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned , seemingly to the consternation of the secret service .
the private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months â€” some 14 .
4 million new jobs in all â€” the longest period of sustained job growth on record .
â€ but as obama also acknowledged , the public anger about the economy is not without empirical basis .
â€œ millions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of america he painted and they can not find themselves in it to save their lives , â€ clinton himself said of obama â€™ s economy in march , while on the campaign trail for his wife .
â€œ people are upset , frankly they â€™ re they â€™ re disoriented , because they don â€™ t see themselves in that picture .
â€ it is this disconnect that haunts obama .
henry m. paulson jr. the treasury secretary , was developing a bank bailout by which the treasury would buy up to $ 700 billion in shaky securities â€” â€œ troubled assets â€ â€” a plan that eventually became the troubled asset relief program , or tarp .
nobody wanted to be seen as a friend of the banks .
they did .
it was a rare moment of bipartisanship , with political consequences .
when obama took office , he turned immediately to trying to pass a stimulus package .
in truth , of course , the political headwinds against stimulus were extraordinary .
â€ but democrats , led by the â€œ deficit hawk â€ wing of the party , also fought against anything too ambitious , and obama , still in the first month of his presidency , was left in the position of negotiating with his own party , such that he was just barely able to get the $ 800 billion on a straight vote .
call it an .
4 trillion , a figure that is nearly twice the original figure .
the then , was counteracted by a stealth stimulus .
â€ frank , with a halfhearted laugh , added , â€œ that â€™ s not a very salable message .
in december 2009 , obama was not reluctant to chastise bankers .
â€œ it â€™ s like when hitler invaded poland in 1939 .
â€ ( schwarzman later apologized . )
it is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents .
â€™ â€™ u2009 â€ he laughed again .
â€œ they â€™ d be constantly complaining about our economic policies .
the new rules may have been sensible in the aftermath of the crisis , but they did take an economic toll .
â€ estimated in 2015 that the regulations would shave $ 895 billion off gross domestic product over the next decade .
it â€™ s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences .
they â€™ re not telling the truth .
unemployment in florida peaked at 11 .
its french chief executive is almost completely detached from the community here in jacksonville he did not even attend obama â€™ s speech .
and as the economy continues to disperse , that sway may be diminishing further .
â€œ and all those constraining factors have been greatly reduced or , in some cases , eliminated entirely .
â€ leaning forward in his chair , obama described the profound structural shifts in the economy over the past two decades that voters often don â€™ t appreciate or acknowledge .
â€œ but they have a sense that it â€™ s a little more of a struggle for them than it might have been for their parents or for their grandparents .
on march 21 , 2010 , congress passed the affordable care act , better known as obamacare .
it has been largely viewed as a social program , a way to provide health insurance to tens of millions of uncovered citizens .
â€ in closing that gap , though , obama has been confronted with a knotty economic and political paradox .
slowing the growth of an industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of the u. s. economy is inevitably going to mean slowing the growth of the economy as a whole .
the legislation was also designed to exert a more subtle economic influence .
â€ obama knows it .
and those things keep me up at night sometimes .
instead , he was shown machine after machine , mostly operated by computers .
no employees necessary .

brazil is enduring its worst economic crisis in decades , with millions of people falling out of the middle class into poverty .

it is not as if the political figures lining up to oust ms. rousseff are viewed as saviors .
rising unemployment and the broad unrest over brazil â€™ s economy only added to the strains between ms. rousseff and congress .
had the economy been ascendant â€” as it was in 2005 when her predecessor , mr. da silva , became embroiled in a scandal â€” she might have emerged unscathed .

2676,20262 , what is alzheimer â€™ s disease ?
there are still a lot of unknowns about the disease , which afflicts more than five million americans .
the memory problems that characterize warning signs of alzheimer â€™ s are usually more frequent , and they begin to interfere with safe or competent daily functioning : forgetting to turn off the stove , leaving home without being properly dressed or forgetting important appointments .
it can also involve mood changes , agitation , social withdrawal and feelings of confusion , and can even affect or slow a person â€™ s gait .
diagnosing alzheimer â€™ s usually involves a series of assessments , including memory and cognitive tests .
clinicians will also do a thorough medical to determine whether the thinking and memory problems can be explained by other diagnoses , such as another type of dementia , a physical illness or side effects from a medication .
brain scans and spinal taps may also be conducted to check for corroborating evidence like the accumulation of amyloid , the hallmark protein of alzheimer â€™ s , in the brain or spinal fluid .
the cause is unknown for most cases .
depression has also been associated with increased risk .
carriers of apoe4 also have a greater chance of developing symptoms at a younger age .
education may promote what is called cognitive reserve , essentially the idea that the more we learn and stimulate our brains , the more brain cells we have that can temporarily compensate for some memory and thinking problems .
another type affects perception or skills .
both types involve a slight decline in these abilities , but it does not prevent the person from functioning independently .
dementia experts have found that sometimes people recognize these issues before they reach the threshold of a clinical diagnosis , and that those people may be more likely to eventually develop alzheimer â€™ s .
alzheimer â€™ s itself typically involves mild , moderate and severe stages .
there are five drugs approved to treat alzheimer â€™ s , sold under the names aricept , exelon , namenda , namzaric and razadyne .

he could also pursue congressional legislation to impose a 45 percent tariff , or tax , on imported chinese goods , as he has proposed .

exports to the united states soared , particularly after china joined the world trade organization in 2001 .
american businesses and consumers bought $ 481 .

school of law .
â€ imposing sweeping tariffs would reverse a mainstay of united states foreign policy .

all told , the united states imported $ 481 .
9 billion in chinese goods in 2015 , a record .
consumers can also buy comparable goods .
when the united states imposed a 35 percent tariff on chinese tires in 2009 , imports of tires from china declined while imports from indonesia , mexico and thailand rose sharply .
china could retaliate by imposing its own tariffs .

â€ according to the legal complaint , hospital officials told dr. that they were worried about security after a â€œ warrior â€ attacked a planned parenthood center in colorado springs in november , killing three people and wounding nine .
if the civil rights office finds that dr. â€™ s rights were violated , it can order the hospital to take corrective action or risk losing its federal funding .
dr. â€™ s legal case rests on a aspect of the church amendment , which was adopted in 1973 after roe v. wade established abortion rights nationwide earlier that year .
the law states that no entity receiving federal money may discriminate against any doctor â€œ because of his religious beliefs or moral convictions respecting sterilization procedures or abortions .
â€ that means that doctors are protected from punishment for supporting abortion , just as they are protected if they oppose it and refuse to participate , according to the complaint .

mr. gatling , then 79 , had himself been wrongfully convicted in 1964 of murdering an artist in the crown heights neighborhood of brooklyn .
according to police reports and , later , testimony at trial , the man demanded money from mr. rothbort .
when the artist refused , the gunman shot him in the chest .
when mr. gatling was interviewed by detectives in the 80th precinct ( which was later absorbed by another precinct ) he told them that he had been paying his rent at the time â€” a fact that his landlord eventually confirmed .
that same evening , mr. gatling , who was was placed in a lineup with three notably shorter men .
â€ a few nights later , mrs. rothbort went back to the station house as mr. gatling was again being interviewed .
this time , after seeing him facing questions , she told detectives that he was the man who had killed her husband .
largely on the basis of this identification , mr. gatling â€™ s lawyers persuaded him to plead guilty â€” in the middle of his trial .
finally , in 1973 , malvina nathanson , a young legal aid lawyer , sent a report on mr. gatling â€™ s case to governor rockefeller .
investigators had to dig up case files from the city archives and track down copies of police reports on microfiche at 1 police plaza .
perhaps more important , they also found an alternate theory of the case that the jury never heard .
mrs. rothbort , moreover , told detectives that she was having an affair with a musician who was living as a boarder in their home .
when the boarder , leon tolbert , was interviewed , he explained to the police that he had recently heard mrs. rothbort tell her husband that she would kill him if he ever hit her again .
much of this information was not provided to the defense , and that was cause enough for the district attorney â€™ s office to request a reversal of mr. gatling â€™ s conviction .

cement shoes .
everyone can describe them , but who has seen them ?
before monday , precious few .
which makes the discovery that morning in brooklyn of a corpse all the more remarkable .
at the other , where his feet should be , was a bucket filled with concrete â€” a mix of cement , sand , gravel and water â€” encasing his legs up to the shins .
crime historians were mystified , struggling to think of similar cases .
â€œ not right offhand .
and yet the shoes fit snugly on the imagination .
you â€™ ll be wearing cement shoes .
an amount of uninterrupted time not commonly associated with murderers looking to cover their tracks .
how long would cement shoes take to harden ?
â€œ like carvel ice cream .
not , like , .
a little thicker .
â€œ depends on the temperature .
â€œ it was cold , â€ mr. bartelotti mused .

2709,20299 , the met opera is struggling .
how can it fill those empty seats ?
but it is becoming a pattern .
it is a daunting house to fill .
it sold an average of 2 , 869 seats per performance â€” more than enough to fill the 2 , 256 seats of the royal opera house in london or the vienna state opera , which can hold 2 , 284 .
what to do ?
michael cooper court the young , even more .
give operagoers in their teens and twenties not just the best seats at cheap prices but also steep discounts at the intermission bar .
the met should start by edging more often into eastern europe : janacek should appear every year , and mussorgsky , prokofiev and shostakovich deserve more than occasional outings .
then there â€™ s the matter of time .
the cavernous theater is a hindrance , admittedly , but gluck and handel ought to be mainstays , not rarities .
and occasional forays into john adams , alongside some muhly and adÃ¨s commissions , aren â€™ t nearly enough contemporary work .
when i showed up , to my amazement , there were some 150 students in attendance and an enormous stack of pizzas .
an 8 p. m. start can be too late for older patrons and suburbanites who face long commutes after the final curtain .
why not the met ?
the more audiences know ( and love ) a performer , the more eager they â€™ ll be to buy tickets to see her .
imagine a series looking at the orpheus myth over time , from monteverdi to birtwistle .
send choristers in costume out to the lobbies to pose for selfies .
don â€™ t let the other met and its costume institute steal all the paparazzi attention .
it â€™ s because there â€™ s no comfortable , exciting space at the opera house to sit down , chat , have unexpected .
my idea ?
how about asking early music ensembles to perform troubadour songs ?
how about verdi â€™ s â€œ otello , â€ which returned this spring in time for the 400th anniversary of shakespeare â€™ s death ?
50 .
what to do ?
michael cooper create a loyalty app that allows users to check in every time they visit .
add in a quiz element that rewards close attention â€” to a detail of a character â€™ s costume , a witty translation in the met titles or a line in the program notes .
but in opera , the trend in recent decades has been toward fewer cuts and treating scores as sacrosanct .
michael cooper after years of illness and cancellations , james levine , the met â€™ s longtime music director , has finally retired .
zachary woolfe ''
just as stunning was how quickly the host tried to reject them .
rarely , too , has the nation been so on edge about its politics .
plenty are also anxious about what he would do in office .
traditional power brokers long preached conservatism and wanted to pursue an immigration overhaul , entitlement cuts , free trade and a hawkish foreign policy , and nominees like john mccain and mitt romney largely embraced that agenda .
their pleas fell on deaf ears .
on the left , too , senator bernie sanders has built his own movement with millions of voters , and $ 210 million in by using online tools as simple as email to seek support .
alongside the turbulent economy were signs of something more profound plaguing white communities , which have increasingly become core republican constituencies : an increase in children born to single parents , higher rates of addiction and suicide , and shortened average life spans .
â€œ i don â€™ t know how you reconcile a lot of them .
â€ â€œ at least , â€ he added , â€œ i hope that â€™ s what â€™ ll happen .

but there also has been real progress for blacks .
at the start of the 1900s , life expectancy for blacks was nearly 15 years less than for whites , according to federal data .
but it was also because blacks , who were subjected to discrimination and segregation , faced worse living conditions and had almost no access to medical care .
from 1982 to about 1995 , blacks â€™ progress in life expectancy stalled , dragged down by homicides , aids and fallout from the crack epidemic .
life expectancy in 1993 stood at 69 .
2 , down from 69 .
4 in 1982 .
â€ but he noted that the improvement has been complicated by the explosive rise in incarceration rates , which has taken a heavy toll on black families .
â€œ i think it â€™ s something to be celebrated .
whatever the case , the national can leave a bad taste .
â€œ but now it â€™ s a problem in the white communities , and it becomes almost a hysteria .

she said she was waging the legal battle out of concern for mr. redstone â€™ s .
on the same day he removed her from the health care directive , he also removed her from his personal estate plan , in which he had planned to leave her $ 50 million and his $ 20 million los angeles mansion .
after viewing the video , judge cowan declared that mr. redstone had appeared to forcefully reject the notion that ms. herzer should be in charge of his health care , or a part of his life at all .
in their filing on sunday , ms. herzer â€™ s lawyers argued that mr. redstone â€™ s vehemence in his testimony may result from â€œ serious cognitive impairment , â€ and manipulation by his daughter , shari redstone .
mr. redstone â€™ s lawyers rejected the suggestion that he was manipulated .
the redstone team also reiterated a caution it has raised repeatedly : that the salacious details being presented by ms. herzer â€™ s lawyers are compromising mr. redstone â€™ s â€œ privacy and dignity .
upon death , or if he is deemed incompetent , mr. redstone â€™ s interests in cbs and viacom are to be held by an irrevocable trust that was created for his five grandchildren .

the islamic state also claims to have downed a russian passenger jet that crashed into the sinai desert in october , killing 224 people .
images on social media showed the bloodied bodies of the officers , dressed in shirts and jeans , slumped in and around a white vehicle that was raked with bullet holes .
but violence has occasionally spilled over into cairo , usually in gun attacks and small bombings .
in november , four police officers at a checkpoint in cairo were killed in a gun attack that was also claimed by the islamic state .
more than 1 , 200 people were arrested last month after public protests over the transfer of two red sea islands to saudi arabia .
almost 600 of them have been formally charged , according to rights groups .
mr. sisi â€™ s popularity has also been damaged by public anger at repeated episodes of police brutality , often over trivial matters , that have resulted in the deaths of ordinary citizens .

michael j. lopuzzo asked the man whether he could pick out his shooter .
then he handed back the 8 booklet , with 23 photos .
lopuzzo , the police would hear about a crazy man in a wheelchair shooting the person who had put him there .
raised during a crack plague , he was a child of government institutions â€” a foster homes , a city jail , six state prison facilities , public housing â€” who , at 29 , had landed at yet another : lincoln medical and mental health center , a red brick monument to both emergency treatment and overburdened recovery care where most gunshot victims in the south bronx are taken .
he carried his silence to the grave .
he told relatives he had been left to lie for hours in his own excrement .
he lit his bedsheets on fire , and cursed and yelled at doctors to send him home .
saving mr. purdy from a bullet in the back was not enough .
â€ mr. purdy was shot in a void : a stretch of sidewalk unwatched by the city â€™ s extensive surveillance equipment , outside the reach of cameras , floodlights or gunshot detectors .
pistol .
mr. purdy told his sister precious parker that the gunman also screamed , â€œ you on my block .
then , inexplicably , the gunman uncocked his pistol and walked away .
â€œ i â€™ m shot .
i â€™ m down , miss , i â€™ m down .
please , â€ mr. purdy told a 911 operator on his cellphone as he lay there alone .
â€œ please hurry up .
i â€™ m afraid .
â€ there was no blood at the scene the slug had spared major blood vessels on the way to mr. purdy â€™ s spine .
at the hospital , mr. purdy lurched between being depressed and being sanguine about his recovery , according to medical records his mother received .
he had once dreamed of being a doctor and had studied nursing in prison .
mr. purdy spent his time in room 6c learning to shift from his bed to a wheelchair and being taught to insert a catheter to urinate .
having lost control of his bowel movements , he told relatives that nurses had left him sitting in his own excrement for hours .
he replied that an attendant had tried to take him to therapy without cleaning the stool he had been lying in for three hours .
he recorded his conversation with ms. and a physical therapist , michael santoro .
mr. purdy sounds confused .
he cautioned that the encounter showed only a snapshot of his care .
â€œ it â€™ s a religion to take care of a spinal cord patient .
there was no improper care by me .
on nov. 26 , thanksgiving day , at 7:34 p. m. with a tv commercial hawking holiday deals playing in the background , mr. purdy recorded another video .
â€ he panned the camera to the pile of waste beside him .
paraplegic patients often languish without thorough and affordable care .
sound recovery requires , among other things , buying a special bed for home and teaching a patient â€™ s relatives to give an enema .
it did not take long for mr. purdy to spiral into desperation .
for a time , a health aide watched him around the clock .
mr. purdy later denied being suicidal .
mr. purdy â€™ s mother and sister visited a few times a week , but without a regular family presence , the burden on him only grew .
an ambulance was arranged to take him at 1 p. m. on dec. 7 .
â€œ that â€™ s a sticky situation once you leave against medical advice .
â€ mr. purdy was told about the risks of blood clots , encouraged to exercise and stop smoking and educated on an injection for blood thinners , records show .
but the records do not include a clear list of prescriptions he received at discharge .
his own daughter was in foster care , sent there in 2012 after he fought with the girl â€™ s mother .
it was a fate he knew himself .
mr. purdy was 5 .
â€œ he didn â€™ t have his real family .
mr. purdy told mr. robinson that he wanted to pursue a music career , and maybe become a doctor .
â€œ that â€™ s just what we do .
â€ ms. johnson recalled telling mourners at her son â€™ s funeral that he had tested her patience as a boy , running in from the street and sticking his hands in pots for an early taste .
as they parted , he would call out , just loud enough to hear , â€œ crackhead .
â€œ but that â€™ s how he really felt about me .
â€ she trailed off , clapping her hands , upset at the memory .
people told the police they heard gunfire from mr. purdy â€™ s shooting .
â€ detectives combed mr. purdy â€™ s arrest record .
he pleaded guilty to attempted robbery in 2011 , after having served nearly 20 months at rikers island .
â€ but the shotgun gangsta crips , mr. purdy â€™ s gang , was not known to be in conflict with gangs in the betances houses .
â€œ unfortunately not comfortable enough to assist in the shooting .
â€ ms. figueroa , his friend , rebuffed detectives twice .
she and her husband , mr. robinson , had their own criminal cases , with ms. figueroa toting her baby in a carrier to an april court appearance for mr. robinson .
but detectives were counting on having more time to build a rapport with mr. purdy , to persuade him to cooperate rather than face the repercussions of his own revenge .
they are linked only by the creeping pace of death â€™ s arrival , and the stalled investigations that can follow .
there was scant progress in the case between his death in december and the medical examiner â€™ s homicide ruling in march .
â€œ the no .
but the delay in ruling the case a homicide appears to have stemmed from toxicology tests , which can reveal contributing causes and take weeks or months to be completed .
they told his mother it looked as if he had taken k2 , a drug whose popularity at the time was creating a panic , though mr. purdy told his mother he had not .
the blood clots pooled in his legs , migrated toward his heart and threw off fatal clots to both lobes of his lungs .
he kept to himself what he meant .
he took trips outside in his wheelchair for a smoke or fresh air .
he fitfully discovered life outside the hospital as a paraplegic .
â€œ it was funny to me , but he was really serious .
â€ as a salve for his fears , his aunt tickled him below the waist .
mr. purdy often hugged him and told him he loved him , and grieved his wilting body .
â€™ â€ â€œ he would sit there and he would cry , â€ mr. parker added .
â€ mr. purdy had been sleeping on a couch in the living room , and mr. parker wheeled him there to rest .
his heart was racing , its rate in the 130s .
nurses tried pulling his clothes off , but it hurt his back .
â€œ so i was like , â€˜ o .
her son threw up his arms , and she pulled off his shirt .
seconds later his eyes rolled back and his body started shaking .
doctors pulled him away .
he was put on a ventilator at 12:43 a. m. a later , he had no pulse .
for 26 minutes , doctors tried to resuscitate him .
at 1:41 a. m. on dec. 14 , he was pronounced dead by dr. allysia guy .
in a dig at the extremists , he broadcast from ice cream parlors and called his talks â€œ isis and ice cream .
millions have watched excerpts from his sermon titled â€œ the crisis of isis , â€ in which he wept as he asked god not to blame other muslims â€œ for what these fools amongst us do .
the islamic state , however , has taken notice .
the group recently threatened the lives of 11 muslim imams and scholars in the west , calling them â€œ apostates â€ who should be killed .
â€™ s field office in washington .
â€œ this is what hurts isis the most .
â€œ is what isis is trying to do , whether to silence these people or to silence others as a deterrent .
they have hired security guards and fortified their workplaces , and some keep guns at home .
they represent a broad spectrum of islamic thought â€” from spiritual sufis to puritanical salafis , and even the more militant â€œ salafi jihadis .
â€ in march , a popular saudi preacher , sheikh aaidh was shot and wounded by a gunman in the philippines , soon after the islamic state â€™ s online magazine had put him on a list of â€œ apostate â€ saudi scholars .
sheikh qarni , who writes islamic inspirational books and has nearly 13 million followers on twitter , had just given a lecture at western mindanao state university , and his assailant was an engineering student .
the organization of islamic cooperation , which represents 57 muslim countries , recently endorsed the declaration .
but i am scared of other people in this land who are very ignorant and bigoted .
and isis is calling me a sellout .
â€ ''
so suddenly i felt like i was put in this very precarious position .
i think they were honoring the kings â€™ intentions .
robert king plus , we were sabotaging things .
we kept starting trash fires in the writers â€™ room .
[ everyone laughs . ]
so the finale just had to honor the end of alicia â€™ s journey .
michelle king i do think she â€™ s a different person .
thematically for the series , it â€™ s all about what are the consequences of even unfortunate things in your life .
alicia started with something horrible , when she was publicly humiliated .
her husband cheated on her with prostitutes .
i think you â€™ ll see that question raised all over .
and then the show became more serialized .
and it â€™ s tricky to do .
they don â€™ t try to live in reality .
but we couldn â€™ t kill someone every episode .
that â€™ s why networks like hospital shows .
there can be blood on the floor in every episode .
for shows that aren â€™ t formulaic procedurals like the â€œ ncis â€ clan or a nighttime soap like â€œ scandal , â€ does the departure of â€œ the good wife â€ herald an end of an era ?
michelle king if it is an end of an era , and i don â€™ t know if it is , it â€™ s because of the actors .
julianna , what would it take for you to commit to another network show with 22 episodes a year ?
margulies there â€™ s no amount of money in the world .
robert king is that true ?
margulies in a heartbeat .
it â€™ s like doing a movie .
because it â€™ s not just a commitment of time on set .
what characters or plot lines saw their arcs changed or dialed back over the course of the show ?
robert king christine baranski â€™ s character [ diane lockhart ] at the very start of the show , was supposed to be kind of the bitchy boss to alicia .
why are we sending her off in this kind of direction ?
let â€™ s have other people be villains .
he was more of a gang lawyer , a little shady .
what was supposed to happen was that when will died , he was someone who really stepped up .
â€ michelle king that happened a lot , didn â€™ t it ?
margulies they had a whole idea for oliver platt , but then he got a series .
[ everyone laughs . ]
you watch tv , and if there â€™ s a priest , you know he â€™ s going to be a child molester .
robert king the thrusting issue .
we â€™ d even have to morph images because we wouldn â€™ t get a take that was clean of thrusting .
but it was kind of amazing how much cbs let us do .
how does a [ series ] show the fact of someone dying , as opposed to a lot of these shows that kill off someone every week ?
if the show were to continue , what are some of the issues that you would want to deal with ?
the right wing is tending to be and the left is looking toward socialism .
and i just thought , oh , that â€™ s an episode .
on this album , grim tidings arrive amid gorgeous backdrops : gentle pianos and acoustic guitars reinforced by a string orchestra .
â€ the album â€™ s opening track , â€œ burn the witch , â€ is a spiral of tension , cryptically portraying a society ignoring its own witch hunts as a clattery , insistent string arrangement ratchets up the dissonance and agitation .
â€ but the songs shouldn â€™ t be reduced to autobiography .
â€œ burn the witch â€ has been hinted at for more than a decade .
both mr. yorke and mr. greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners , lovers of melody and explorers of idioms , makers of puzzles who don â€™ t shy away from emotion .
and the music sounds unplugged even where it â€™ s obviously programmed .
â€œ a path trails off and heads down the mountain , â€ he sings .
â€œ i don â€™ t know where it don â€™ t really care .
â€ the album ends with â€œ true love waits , â€ a love song radiohead wrote in the 1990s and first recorded on a 2001 live ep , â€œ i might be wrong , â€ with mr. yorke simply strumming and singing alone , building up to the song â€™ s pleading refrain , â€œ don â€™ t leave , don â€™ t leave .
the same piano figure sketches the song â€™ s other chords through the first verse .
ms .
it was a bikini .
â€œ that must be a pretty picture , you dropping to your knees , â€ he told a female contestant on â€œ the celebrity apprentice .
â€ a lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newborn ?
but the 1990 episode at that ms .
in all , more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks .
he simultaneously nurtured women â€™ s careers and mocked their physical appearance .

and women will tell you that .
he had celebrity .
he had wealth .
he had connections .
for ms .
â€œ donald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to campus were pretty , â€ recalled george white , a fellow student in the class of 1964 .
â€œ for donald , â€ he added , â€œ it â€™ s display .
fred trump set her straight , she recalled in a previously unpublished interview with michael d â€™ antonio , the author of â€œ the truth about trump .
as she recalls it , he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner .
â€œ that â€™ s hurtful to people .
he possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it .
years later , after she had gained a significant amount of weight , ms. res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from mr. trump .
â€œ â€˜ you like your candy , â€™ â€ she recalled him telling her .
â€œ it was him reminding me that i was overweight .
but she saw it as friendly encouragement , not a cruel insult .
mr. trump frequently sought assurances â€” at times from strangers â€” that the women in his life were beautiful .
he turned to brook antoinette mahealani lee , miss universe at the time , and asked for her opinion of his daughter â€™ s body .
â€œ â€˜ don â€™ t you think my daughter â€™ s hot ?
â€˜ i was like , â€˜ really ? â€™ that â€™ s just weird .
she was 16 .
that â€™ s creepy .
â€ ms .
both expressed gratitude for the chances mr. trump had taken on them .
he entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her the titles to match .
â€œ what do they call that ?
i am going after her , â€™ â€ mr. houraney recalled , adding : â€œ i thought the man was joking .
i laughed .
â€œ basically he throughout that dinner , when he wasn â€™ t groping me under the table , â€ she testified .
ms. harth withdrew her own lawsuit against mr. trump alleging unwanted advances , but she has stood by her original claims .
after alicia machado won the 1996 miss universe title , something very human happened : she gained weight .

2720,20310 , two-hour marathon .
can it be done ?
tulu wore a mask and a harness fitted with a small battery pack and a device known as a gas analyzer .
a plow had furrowed the track with lane markers .
eucalyptus trees provided a wind break .
pacing him on a bicycle was the physiologist yannis pitsiladis .
the current record of 2 hours 2 minutes 57 seconds was set in 2014 by dennis kimetto of kenya .
â€œ nineteen , 20 , 21 , is that a negative ?
â€ so pitsiladis closely observed chala tulu .
for the vo2 max testing , pitsiladis received ethical clearance from addis ababa university in the ethiopian capital , where he is a visiting professor .
and he sought permission from bekoji elementary â€™ s principal , vice principal and renowned coach , sentayehu eshetu .
the men gathered in a small office as pitsiladis explained his enterprise , the sub2 project .
he introduced his altitude expert , zeru bekele , an ethiopian , clarifying that this was not an endeavor wholly by outsiders .
pitsiladis spoke respectfully of eshetu , the coach , who had discovered bekele and other olympic champions , choosing potential stars by their body type : short torsos and long legs .
â€œ my machine can look inside .
yet ethiopia â€™ s has faced stiff competition from kenya and , recently , from mo farah , a native of neighboring somalia and a british citizen who won the 5 , 000 meters and the 10 , 000 meters at the 2012 london olympics â€” distances once dominated by gebrselassie and bekele .
â€œ we don â€™ t have the right coach .
we don â€™ t have the right nutritionist .
we don â€™ t have psychologist .
no doctor .
since mo farah , they start to think about the science .
â€ bekoji seemed an ideal place for pitsiladis to start his talent search .
before tulu was chosen for the vo2 max test , pitsiladis asked him a few questions .
what did he want to become ?
â€œ very good , very good , â€ pitsiladis called out as tulu began to circle the track .
his heels nearly kicked his backside in a manner similar to that of bekele , whose likeness , along with the olympic rings , was painted on the side of a school building .
particularly intriguing to pitsiladis was that tulu preferred to run without his shoes and had removed them for the test .
( he won again in 1964 , this time in shoes . )
â€™ â€ relatively little scientific research has been conducted on the world â€™ s fastest marathon runners .
the biomedical lab at addis ababa university contains hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment acquired over the years â€” freezers and sophisticated machines , resembling bread makers , that analyze genes and blood .
the canister , needed to calibrate the vo2 max tests , had been shipped from italy in november because none were available in ethiopia .
nearly three months later , it had not cleared customs .
before heading to bekoji , pitsiladis and zeru bekele , his altitude expert , spent a maddening five hours extricating the cylinder from the authorities at bole international airport in addis ababa .
bekele spent an hour picking up the agent and driving her to the airport .
â€œ this is ridiculous .
finally , bekele secured the canister and took it to pitsiladis at his hotel .
pitsiladis cradled it like a baby .
earlier , as pitsiladis had arrived and children had gathered around his van , he had said with disbelief and mild disappointment , â€œ they â€™ re all wearing something on their feet ! â€ but kenenisa bekele had arranged for the trip with a phone call to eshetu , his former coach , so pitsiladis proceeded with the testing .
â€œ these are city kids .
he had more immediate concerns .
pitsiladis had hoped kenenisa bekele would be that athlete , but months of dealing with him suggested serious obstacles might still lie ahead as pitsiladis applied his science to elite runners in ethiopia .
even then , pitsiladis showed a knack for experimenting in training .
to mimic the sticky summer conditions in asia , pitsiladis devised a thermal chamber in a home in addis ababa , employing heaters and kettles of boiling water while bekele trained on a treadmill .
but injury sideswiped him .
at last year â€™ s dubai marathon in the united arab emirates , he dropped out after 18 Â½ miles , and he withdrew from the london marathon three months later .
in july , bekele arrived at pitsiladis â€™ s lab in england about 25 pounds above his competitive weight of 123 .
he limped when he walked .
his right calf was nearly an inch smaller around than his left calf .
â€ injuries had piled up .
a stress fracture in his ankle .
a torn calf muscle .
strained achilles â€™ tendons .
it was as if a string had been pulled , yanking bekele â€™ s back and legs and feet , leaving his muscles out of balance .
bekele was 33 .
his words were hopeful , if not a sure bet .
so although pitsiladis and bekele agreed to renew their partnership , it was full of operatic uncertainty .
â€ they could not even agree on what foods were good for runners to eat .
after a workout in september , pitsiladis had bekele stop his sport utility vehicle at a roadside stand in addis ababa and climbed out to buy bananas .
â€ pitsiladis told him : â€œ they â€™ re good all the time .
they refuel the muscles .
â€ bekele did not mean he disliked the taste .
when he visited addis ababa in september , pitsiladis found that bekele had bought into some of the prescribed rehab program but not all of it .
he agreed to quit eating cakes and to adhere to a traditional , ethiopian diet of stews and a spongy flatbread called injera .
by late september , bekele had dropped 11 pounds .
â€œ just enough to keep you alive , â€ pitsiladis told bekele .
â€œ if they want to kill you , they kill you indirectly .
according to pitsiladis , bekele told him : â€œ i don â€™ t need this treatment .
all i need is for the priests to o. k. me .
he stayed .
â€œ you are in control of your destiny , not these people around you .
â€ when he left addis ababa in september , pitsiladis seemed more encouraged .
bekele had agreed to regular physiotherapy .
he was sticking to his diet .
in early november , the tentative assurance evaporated .
his training became irregular .
he put on weight and sometimes resisted physiotherapy .
in january , bekele traveled to munich to visit a popular and controversial doctor , .
his supporters , including the jamaican sprint star usain bolt , swear by him and call him healing hans .
travis tygart , the chief executive of the united states agency , once described â€™ s injections to espn as a â€œ treatment .
( declined a request for an interview . )
that was the hope , anyway .
the london marathon was only 10 weeks away .
in march , bekele turned inward , secretive , as he sometimes had at the height of his career .
he declined to tell pitsiladis about his training regimen .
bekele was no longer the broken runner he had been .
and you need to trust me 100 percent .
â€ eliud kipchoge of kenya eventually won in 2:03:05 , the marathon ever .
while bekele was left to run alone in the final miles , he gamely finished third in 2:06:36 .
â€œ not bad .
â€ pitsiladis hugged bekele .
perhaps now , bekele would more readily buy into a scientific approach to training .
â€œ you â€™ re here once .
you want to do something that matters .

the opinion is the latest indication that the supreme court , which currently has eight members , is exploring every avenue to avoid deadlocks , even if it does not decide the question the justices have agreed to address .
since then , the court has deadlocked three times , including in a major case on public unions .

chinese officials have not formally disclosed that they are conducting the reviews , and their existence has not been previously confirmed outside of rare , brief mentions in local news media .

apple has seen new pressure in china as regulators have shut down its ibooks and itunes movies stores there .

that the governor â€™ s racy phone calls became public at all is because of what may be the most significant and sweeping crisis of the lot : the impending trial of the alabama house speaker , michael g. hubbard , described by friends and foes as the most powerful man in state politics .

reacting to that account , the i. o. c. called a special meeting of its executive board , which convened by telephone on tuesday .

the senate â€™ s passage of the bill , which will now be taken up in the house , is another sign of escalating tensions in a relationship between the united states and saudi arabia that once received little scrutiny from lawmakers .

as the raging blaze , now more than a week old , turned north , skirting the western edge of fort mcmurray on monday afternoon and evening , a series of small camps holding about 600 oil sands workers were evacuated .
in normal times , up to 7 , 400 people work at syncrude , producing up to 350 , 000 barrels of oil a day .
chad morrison , the head of alberta â€™ s wildfire service , said that the fire was now close to the syncrude and suncor oil sands plants .
but mr. morrison added that â€œ we feel there â€™ s good resilience with the industrial sites .
â€ in addition to having and fire brigades of their own , a wide band of gravel surrounds the oil sands operations as a fire break .
the plants where the bitumen is separated from sand and then converted into a synthetic crude oil present a potentially greater fire risk .
while firefighting efforts have been concentrated on preserving the undamaged parts of fort mcmurray , reopening the oil sands plants , which generally lie to the north , has also been a priority .
in an analysis written just before the latest setback , the conference board of canada estimated that 14 days of shutdown would mean a loss of production valued at 985 million canadian dollars , about $ 762 million .
royalties from the oil sands are also an important part of the provincial budget .

the mississippi case began with an action filed on july 24 , 1965 , on behalf of 131 children .
a justice department motion filed in 2011 illustrated the inequities between the poor and in cleveland , a mississippi delta town with a population of about 12 , 000 .

schools on the east side of the tracks were originally black .
she added that she believed there were several hundred legal school desegregation cases nationwide .
hospital ?
as they prepared to fire , the gunship â€™ s crew members radioed to the ground force commander , a united states army special forces major , for more information .
affirm .
â€ at roughly the same time , 150 miles south in kabul , guilhem molinie , the head of the afghan mission for doctors without borders , known by its french initials , m. s. f. was woken by a phone call : his hospital in kunduz was burning .
a few minutes later , he received a chilling update : it was being bombed from the air .
he began frantically calling the united states military , the united nations , anyone who might be able to make it stop .
according to m. s. f. at least 42 people were killed in the attack and dozens injured .
it was among the most shocking massacres in the led war in afghanistan , and certainly the most baffling .
on april 29 , seven months after the bombing , the united states military released a heavily redacted version of its investigation into the airstrike .
â€œ the investigation concluded that the personnel involved did not know they were striking a medical facility , â€ gen. joseph votel , the head of the military â€™ s central command , said at a news conference .
â€œ they were absolutely trying to do the right thing .
when maj. michael hutchinson , known to his friends as hutch , redeployed last year to afghanistan , he was sure â€” as he later told military investigators â€” that getting outside the wire to engage in combat was mostly a thing of the past .
it was their war now .
but as the afghan government has begun to lose ground against the taliban , united states forces have found themselves pulled back into combat .
his identity was confirmed by joe kasper , representative duncan hunter â€™ s chief of staff , who has been in contact with special forces who were in kunduz .
from the start , hutchinson had been wary of kunduz and its messy politics .
â€œ ironically , i probably jinxed myself on this , â€ he later told military investigators .
it â€™ s not something that we can effectively weigh in on .
on aug. 13 , brig .
â€œ kunduz is â€” is not now and has not been in danger of being overrun by the taliban .
he spoke by phone from outside the city in the weeks after the attack .
â€œ we broke our enemy .
thousands of residents jammed the highways as they fled to neighboring cities meanwhile , hordes of taliban fighters , some from surrounding provinces , streamed into the city , attracted by the prospect of a major victory .
it was the first time since 2001 that the taliban had captured a provincial capital .
hutchinson was put in command of the entire force .
when the taliban attacked the airport plateau that evening , the defenders began fleeing the perimeter , but the special forces called in airstrikes , which hammered the insurgent forces , breaking their offensive and leaving dozens of dead fighters scattered through the arid hills .
â€ earlier that same day , a toyota corolla pulled up to the main entrance of the doctors without borders hospital in kunduz .
with him was abdul salam , the â€œ shadow governor â€ responsible for kunduz .
afghan forces have been especially resentful of the fact that as patients , insurgents in m. s. f. facilities are entitled to the protection of international law .
in 2004 , five m. s. f. staff members were shot in an unsolved murder .
but according to m. s. f. afghan officials presented them with credible evidence that local forces were actually responsible .
no action was taken against them by the government , and the organization pulled out of the country .
when i visited kunduz in november , their anger was still surprisingly raw , despite the recent destruction of the hospital .
on july 1 , an episode occurred that should have been , in retrospect , a warning sign for all involved .
after m. s. f. phoned the governor and the police chief , the commandos were called off .
huzaifa would be killed seven weeks later â€” by an american drone , according to a senior afghan special forces commander â€” but bitterness about the hospital raid lingered among the kunduz security forces .
his men had accompanied the police commandos to the hospital .
campbell , who was in kabul , was not happy with the afghans .
â€œ he had a lot on his plate .
this was a strategically vital mission , and the whole world was watching .
the plan hutchinson submitted , called kunduz clearing patrol , was a risky mission to strike deep into the city , where his men and the afghan commandos would take over the police and governor â€™ s compound and set up a forward stronghold .
hutchinson later admitted that he had underestimated the number of taliban in the city as â€œ a small group of dedicated individuals .
â€œ we all agreed it had to happen fast , and the only people who were willing to go in , unfortunately , were people who did not know the city of kunduz .
they were hit by repeated taliban ambushes and called in airstrikes from a circling gunship , killing dozens of insurgents .
when the sun rose , the attacks began .
â€œ they can â€™ t sit out there and die on the road .
â€ armed with this authorization and ordered to take back the city of kunduz , the special forces called in air support for the afghan commandos , who , taking advantage of their superior vision capabilities , would set out from the police compound to raid taliban positions around the city at night .
â€ in a city where all other institutions had been abandoned by their staff , the m. s. f. hospital was a lifeline for the people of kunduz .
â€ a shouldered , stocky man with a shy smile , esmat and his fellow surgeons worked in alternating shifts .
esmat had to amputate the leg of a girl .
it was a bloody and chaotic scene .
there , stripped naked under the surgeon â€™ s lamp , taliban fighters , civilians and government soldiers alike became patients whose lives needed to be saved .
as the wards overflowed , the staff laid down mattresses between the beds and in the hallways and stretched the hospital to fit 130 .
â€œ i saw a lot of dead children .
they left their weapons outside or handed them over at the gun lockers at the entrance .
â€ m. s. f. did allow caretakers and patients to keep their cellphones , however , and i was told by several staff members and civilians present that some taliban caretakers also brought in radios .
taliban vehicles were also allowed inside the hospital grounds to drop off critically injured patients .
â€œ they had raised their flag and established their headquarters there .
yaftali , the k. k. a. commander , told me that his unit â€™ s wolfhound radio direction finders , which allowed them to determine the range and bearing of enemy radios , picked up taliban transmissions from inside the hospital .
â€œ the taliban were inside and outside the hospital .
on sept. 29 , he provided resolute support with gps coordinates for four of m. s. f. â€™ s facilities in kunduz , including the hospital , as a precaution .
there was no electricity , and the price of basics like bread and cooking oil had shot up , for those who could find them at all .
heading out in search of supplies meant risking your life in the crossfire on the streets .
with his father deaf and disabled , his family relied on their eldest son as their breadwinner .
morsal , 15 , was quiet and fastidious like him , while madina , at 5 the youngest in the family , was impish and cheeked .
at night , they screamed in fear when bombs struck nearby .
they begged the family to leave kunduz .
taliban fighters stopped them at a checkpoint but let them pass â€” civilians were free to flee if they wished .
he wanted the equivalent of $ 200 to take them to kabul , five times as much as the normal rate , and they had no choice but to accept .
returning home with the driver , he and his friend packed their families into the toyota station wagon , 14 people in total , most of them women and children .
the driver set off south , toward kabul .
as the driver wheeled around , bullets tore through the back of the car .
when esmat arrived in the red room , he found morsal laid out , pale and beautiful .
she was dead from a head wound .
â€œ my god , what is the sin of these people ? â€ he cried .
madina â€™ s liver and kidney had been badly lacerated .
after dark , the insurgents â€™ daily assault on the police compound had petered out , and the commandos planned to take three of their wounded comrades back to the airport , resupply and then drive back into the city toward the n. d. s. compound , on a northbound path that would take them past the m. s. f. hospital .
the commandos asked hutchinson to provide them with air support , and he replied that he would take care of them .
in fact , it was the hospital .
â€ he later told investigators that the afghans described â€œ a long shaped building with a small offshoot .
â€ that description didn â€™ t resemble the n. d. s. headquarters .
it matched the hospital .
at 2 in the morning , the hospital was quiet .
most of the roughly 300 staff members , patients and caretakers were asleep .
he had been worried that she might die on the operating table , but she pulled through .
shortly after 2 in the morning , both men were woken by loud blasts and flashes of light .
they didn â€™ t know it , but they were running toward danger .
they fell to the ground .
satar â€™ s right arm had been blown off at the shoulder .
faizullah could feel his own hot blood gushing down his back .
faizullah crawled up to satar and held him .
â€œ i know , â€ faizullah replied .
â€ as they cowered , reciting the islamic profession of faith , more shrapnel struck them .
three times , faizullah tried to stand them up , struggling with the bulky satar , whose legs seemed to be paralyzed , before another explosion would send them sprawling .
the sound of the blasts was the hardest thing to bear .
he was limp and silent .
he â€™ s dead , faizullah thought , and i â€™ ll die if i stay here .
take care of my children .
his right leg was missing at the knee , and blood was spurting and pooling underneath him .
as they looked back at the hospital , another round of shells struck the driveway where they had just been standing , partly collapsing its roof .
the lawn was lit with its dancing orange flame .
this , in turn , raises the question of what targeting information was provided by the afghan forces .
â€ but it â€™ s actually a rather specific description that corresponds to m. s. f. â€™ s distinctive layout .
indeed , according to the report , when the returned to a normal altitude , the sensor operator , worried that the navigation system had failed earlier , tried punching in the original grid coordinates , and this time it aimed his sensor at the n. d. s. headquarters .
they all claimed not to know or recall what exactly it was .
a member of the gunship crew also said they received â€œ multiple grids â€ that night .
did afghan forces , influenced by their longstanding animosity for m. s. f. believe that it had become a taliban headquarters and needed to be taken out ?
when i interviewed them in november , none of the afghan forces would claim responsibility for passing on the description to the special forces .
the k. k. a .
â€ ( independent investigations have revealed no evidence to suggest that armed taliban fighters were inside the hospital or firing from nearby . )
on may 3 , denouncing a pattern of attacks against medical facilities in conflict zones , the united nations security council adopted resolution 2286 , which called for an end to impunity for those responsible .
oddly , some of the individuals seated around the security council â€™ s shaped table represented countries involved in these strikes .
â€œ when you look at the track record of the last few months , when four out of the five permanent members of the security council have been involved in bombing m. s. f. facilities , it â€™ s a question that we urgently need to have answered .
according to the united nations , on feb. 18 , afghan police commandos stormed into a clinic run by the swedish committee for afghanistan and executed two patients and a teenage caretaker who were suspected of being insurgents .
jorgen holmstrom , the s. c. a .
faizullah , the archivist , survived , but his young friend amin did not .
â€œ she died , and she burned .
editor â€™ s note : the united states military initially declined to comment and referred questions to the afghan government , which also declined to comment .
